<h2 id="conceptual-approach">Conceptual Approach</h2>
<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The HL7 Standard makes no assumptions about the ownership of data. It also makes no requirements of its own on the subsequent action of the recipient of data, nor does it make any assumption about the design or architecture of the receiving application system. The scope of HL7 is restricted to the specification of messages between application systems, and the events triggering them. HL7 does not explicitly support, but can be used with, systems that support store and forward and data broadcast facilities (see the HL7 Implementation Support Guide).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="trigger-events">Trigger events</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Standard is written from the assumption that an event in the real world of healthcare creates the need for data to flow among systems. The real-world event is called the <strong>trigger event</strong>. For example, the trigger event <strong>a patient is admitted</strong> MAY cause the need for data about that patient to be sent to a number of other systems. The trigger event, <strong>an observation (e.g., a CBC result) for a patient is</strong> <strong>available,</strong> MAY cause the need for that observation to be sent to a number of other systems. When the transfer of information is initiated by the application system that deals with the triggering event, the exchange is termed an <strong>unsolicited update</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: No assumption is made about the design or architecture of the application/ system creating the unsolicited update. The scope of HL7 is restricted to the specification of messages between application/ systems and the events triggering them.</p>
<p>HL7 allows the use of trigger events at several different levels of data granularity and inter-relationships. For example, most Patient Administration (ADT) trigger events concern single objects (such as an admit event, which creates a message that contains data about a single person and/or account). Other ADT trigger events are concerned with relationships between more than one object (e.g., the merge events, which specify patient or account merges). Some ADT trigger events pertain to a collection of objects that MAY have no significant inter-relationships (e.g., a record-oriented location-based query, whose response contains data about a collection of inpatients who are related only temporarily, by local geography).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="acknowledgments-original-mode">Acknowledgments: original mode</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When the unsolicited update is sent from one system to another, this acknowledgment mode specifies that it be acknowledged at the application level. The reasoning is that it is not sufficient to know that the underlying communications system guaranteed delivery of the message. It is also necessary to know that the receiving application processed the data successfully at a logical application level.</p>
<p>The acknowledgment MAY contain data of interest to the system that initiated the exchange. For example, if a patient care system has processed the trigger event <strong>a lab test is ordered for a patient</strong>, it MAY send an unsolicited update to a lab application identifying the patient, the test ordered, and various other information about the order. The ancillary system will acknowledge the order when it has processed it successfully. For some pairings of patient care and ancillary department systems the acknowledgment MAY also include the ancillary identification number that was assigned (HL7 does not require Order Entry and Results Reporting applications to interface in this manner, but it supports those that do).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <del>Original mode acknowledgment was replaced by enhanced mode acknowledgment in version 2.2. Implementers SHALL always value MSH-15 and MSH-16</del> Original mode allows the sender to transmit and receive on a single communication channel.</p>
<p>The HL7 Standard makes no functional interpretation of the requirement that a system commit the data in a message to its database before acknowledging it. All that is required is that the receiving system accept responsibility for the data, providing the same integrity test that it would apply to data from any source. To continue the prior example, the ancillary system MAY acknowledge the order after placing it in an input queue, expecting to fully process the order into its database at a future time. The only assumption is that the input queue is maintained at the same level of integrity as the database.</p>
<p>Instances of messages are transient by nature, and can not be expected by transmitter and/or receiver to be persistent after acknowledgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="acknowledgments-enhanced-mode">Acknowledgments: enhanced mode</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The HL7 acknowledgment paradigm has been extended to distinguish both accept and application acknowledgments, as well the conditions under which each is required. With a positive accept acknowledgment, the receiving system commits the message to safe storage in a manner that releases the sending system from the need to resend the message. After the message has been processed by the receiving system, an application acknowledgment MAY be used to return the resultant status to the sending system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="queries">Queries</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Query documentation including messages, segments, special protocols, implementation considerations and examples have been moved to chapter 5. The unsolicited display messages were also moved because their message syntax is query-like in nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="communications-environment">Communications Environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The HL7 Standard defines the messages as they are exchanged among application entities and the procedures used to exchange them. As such, it conceptually operates at the seventh level of the ISO model for Open System Intercon­nection (OSI). It is primarily concerned with the data content and interrelationship of messages and with communicating certain application-level error conditions.</p>
<p>Since the OSI protocols are not universally implemented, the HL7 Working Group is interested in providing standards that will be useful in the interim. It is also recognized that there is now, and will continue to be, interest in communicating health data among systems operating in communications environ­ments that provide a high level of functionality, but use protocols other than ISO OSI. The universe of environments of interest to HL7 includes, but is not restricted to:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li><blockquote>
<p>ad hoc environments that do not provide even basic transport reliability. Such environments consist of point-to-point RS-232 links, modems, and even LANs, if their connection to host computers is made via RS-232 communications links. Until OSI high level standards become truly prevalent, many healthcare interfaces will be implemented over such links. In such an environment, the HL7 Lower Level Protocols (LLP) MAY be used between systems to enhance the capabilities of the communications environment. The HL7 Lower Level Protocols are defined in the HL7 Implementation Guide, which is not an official part of the Standard.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>environments that support a robust transport level, but do not meet the high level requirements. This includes environments such as TCP/IP, DECNET, and SNA.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>ISO and proprietary networks that implement up to presentation and other high level services. IBM's SNA LU6.2 and IETF NFS are examples of complete proprietary networks.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>two or more applications running on the same physical and/or logical machine that are not tightly integrated. In these environments, the messaging capabilities MAY be provided by inter-process communications services (e.g., Pipes in a UNIX System).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The HL7 Standard assumes that the communications environment will provide the following capabilities:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li><blockquote>
<p>error free transmission. Applications can assume that they correctly received all of the transmitted bytes in the order in which they were sent. This implies that error checking is done at a lower level. However, sending applications MAY NOT assume that the message was actually received without receiving an acknowledgment message.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>character conversion. If the two machines exchanging data use different representations of the same character set, the communications environment will convert the data from one representation to the other.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>message length. HL7 sets no limits on the maximum size of HL7 messages. The Standard assumes that the communications environment can transport messages of any length that might be necessary. In practice, sites MAY agree to place some upper bound on the size of messages and MAY use the message continuation protocol, described later in this chapter, for messages that exceed the upper limit.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just as HL7 makes no assumptions about the design or architecture of the application systems sending and receiving HL7 messages, it makes no assumptions about the communications environment beyond those listed above. In particular, aside from the above assumptions, the communications environment, including its architecture, design and implementation, is outside the scope of HL7.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="message-framework">Message Framework</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section defines the constituents of messages and provides the methodology for defining abstract messages that are used in later chapters. Message construction rules can be found in section 2.5.5.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="messages">Messages </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>message</strong> is the atomic unit of data transferred between systems. It is comprised of a group of segments in a defined sequence. Each message has a <strong>message type</strong> that defines its purpose. For example the ADT Message type is used to transmit portions of a patient's Patient Administration (ADT) data from one system to another. A three-character code contained within each message identifies its type. These are listed in the Message Type list, Appendix A.</p>
<p>The real-world event that initiates an exchange of messages is called a trigger event. See Section <em>2.3.1</em>, "<em>Trigger events</em>," for a more detailed description of trigger events. Refer to <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70003"><em>HL7 Table 0003 – Event type</em></a> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for a listing of all defined trigger events. These codes represent values such as <strong>A patient is admitted</strong> or <strong>An order event occurred</strong>. There is a one-to-many relationship between message types and trigger event codes. The same trigger event code SHALL NOT be associated with more than one message type; however a message type MAY be associated with more than one trigger event code.</p>
<p>All message types and trigger event codes beginning with the letter "Z" are reserved for locally defined messages. Z codes SHALL NOT be defined within the HL7 Standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="segments-and-segment-groups">Segments and segment groups</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>segment</strong> is a logical grouping of data fields. Segments of a message MAY be required or optional. They MAY occur only once in a message or they MAY be allowed to repeat. Each segment is given a name. For example, the ADT message MAY contain the following segments: Message Header (MSH), Event Type (EVN), Patient ID (PID), and Patient Visit (PV1).</p>
<p>Each segment is identified by a unique three-character code known as the Segment ID. Although the actual segments are defined in various chapters, the ID codes assigned to the various segments are listed in Appendix A.</p>
<p>All segment ID codes beginning with the letter <strong>Z</strong> are reserved for locally defined segments. Z Codes SHALL NOT be defined within the HL7 Standard.</p>
<p>Two or more segments MAY be organized as a logical unit called a segment group. A segment group MAY be required or optional and might or might not repeat. As of v 2.5, the first segment in a newly defined segment group will be required to help ensure that unparsable messages will not be inadvertently defined. This required first segment is known as the anchor segment.</p>
<p>A segment group is assigned a name that represents a permanent identifier that SHALLNOT be changed.</p>
<p>A named segment X MAY occur more than once in an abstract message syntax. This differs from repetition described earlier in this section. When this occurs, the following rules SHALL be adhered to:</p>
<p>If, within an abstract message syntax, a named segment X appears in two individual or group locations, and</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li><blockquote>
<p>Either appearance is optional or repeating in an individual location or,</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>either appearance is optional or repeating in a group location</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>then, the occurrences of segment X SHALL be separated by at least one required segment of a different name so that no ambiguity can exist as to the individual or group location of any occurrence of segment X in a message instance.</p>
<p>Examples of proper segment grouping</p>

<p>HL7 does not care how systems actually store data within an application. When fields are transmitted, they are sent as character strings</p>
<p>A field SHALL exist in one of three population states in an HL7 message:</p>
<p><strong>Populated</strong>. (Synonyms: valued, non-blank, not blank, not empty.) The sending system sends a value in the field. For example, if a sending system includes medical record number, that would be communicated as |1234567^^^MR^KP-CA|.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> that the field might be populated with a code that means "no information" or "unknown".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not populated</strong>. (Synonyms: unpopulated, not valued, unvalued, blank, empty, not present, missing.) The sending system does not supply a value for the field. The Sender might or might not have a value for the field. The receiving system can make no inference regarding the absence of an element value if there is not a conformance profile governing the implementation. However, if there is a Conformance Message Profile in effect, then special rules apply; see section 2.B, "Conformance Using Message Profiles".</p>
<p><strong>Null. HL7 v2.x does not have an explicit concept for null values.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Populated with Delete Indicator:</strong> Any existing value for the corresponding data base element in the receiving application SHOULD be deleted.

<p>There are a number of data types defined by HL7. See section <em>2.15</em>, "<a href="file:///D:\Eigene%20Dateien\V27_CH02A_DataTypes.doc"><em>Data types</em></a>" and in Chapter 2A.</p>

<p>Data types MAY be either primitive or composite. Primitive data types consist of a series of characters as specified by the data type. Composite data types are made up of a series of components that are themselves assigned to a data type, which MAY again be either primitive or composite data types. In the case of composite data types, the components of a component are called sub-components, and they SHALL only be assigned primitive data types.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In constructing a message, certain special characters are used. They are the segment terminator, the field separator, the component separator, subcomponent separator, repetition separator, escape character and truncation character. The segment terminator is always a carriage return (in ASCII 13,hex 0D).. The other delimiters are defined in the MSH segment, with the field delimiter in the 4th character position, and the other delimiters occurring as in the field called Encoding Characters, which is the first field after the segment ID. The delimiter values used in the MSH segment are the delimiter values used throughout the entire message. In the absence of other considerations, HL7 recommends the suggested values found in Figure 2-1 delimiter values.</p>
<p>At any given site, the subset of the possible delimiters MAY be limited by negotiations between applications. This implies that the receiving applications will use the agreed upon delimiters, as they appear in the Message Header segment (MSH), to parse the message.</p>

<h3 id="length-1">Length</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>While the length is not generally of conceptual importance in HL7 messages, most HL7 aware applications are implemented using some form of data storage that imposes length limitations on the data. This section describes how the lengths of the fields are controlled, and how interoperability can be arranged in this context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="normative-length">Normative Length</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>For some fields or components, the value domain of the content leads to clearly established boundaries for minimum and/or maximum length of the content. In these cases, these known limits are specified for the item. Normative lengths are only specified for primitive data types.</p>
<p>Examples of value domains that have clearly established boundaries for minimum and maximum length:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>A date/time field: See 2.A.22 DTM date/time for detailed examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>4..4 for year</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>4..6 for Year to month</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>8..8 for year to day</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>A component whose values are limited to a set of fixed length strings, e.g.(ABC, SYL, or IDE)A component that contains a reference to a field in a message</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The information is given in one of two forms:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The minimum and the maximum length separated by two dots, e.g. m..n</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>the list of possible values for length separated by commas, e.g. x,y,z</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When a normative length is asserted and assertion is a range, conformant messages SHALL have a length that lies within the boundaries specified. The boundaries are inclusive, so a length of 1..2 means the length of the item SHALL be either 1 or 2. When a normative length is asserted and assertion is a list of values, conformant messages SHALL have a length that is one of the values in the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The minimum length is always 1 or more. If an item is optional, and there is no content present, the item is considered as not populated, rather than present with a length of 0.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The deletion indicator is treated as having no length and therefore fits to all length specifications.</p>
<h4 id="length-persistent-data-stores">Length &amp; Persistent Data Stores</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>For many fields or components, the value domain of the content does not lead to clearly established boundaries for minimum and/or maximum length of the content.</p>
<p>Examples of value domains that do not have clearly established boundaries for minimum and maximum length:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Parts of Names and Addresses</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Codes defined in external code systems</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Descriptive text</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In many cases, systems store the information of these value domains using data storage mechanisms that have fixed lengths, such as relational databases, and must impose a limitation on the amount of information that can be stored. Though this does not directly impact on the length of the item in the instance, nevertheless the storage length has great significance for establishing interoperability.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="truncation-pattern">Truncation Pattern</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>For technical and/or architectural reasons, many applications must define a limit to the length that they will store for a particular item. This creates a need for the length of an element to be defined somewhere and raises the question of what should happen if a real world value is longer than the acceptable value. The problem of how to handle this is unaffected by whether it is the standard that defines the length, or the receiving system that defines the length: what can be done?</p>
<p>The most obvious response is that the data must be rejected, and either the message cannot be constructed or must be rejected completely. For some data items, this is the only clinically safe behaviour.On the other hand, for some data items such as names and addresses, this is generally unwelcome information – the system can still function to some degree in the presence of truncated data.</p>
<p>However truncation of data can have later consequences – if a data item such as a particularly long surname is truncated, and then returned to the source application in the truncated form, the source application might not correctly match on the truncated name.</p>
<p>For this reason, when values are truncated because they are too long (whether because some applicable specification limits the length of the item, or because the application is not able to store the full value), the value SHOULD be truncated at N-1, where N is the length limit, and the final character replaced with a special truncation character. This means that whenever that value is subsequently processed later, either by the system, a different system, or a human user, the fact that the value has been truncated has been preserved, and the information can be handled accordingly.</p>
<p>The truncation character is not fixed; applications MAY use any character. The truncation character used in the message is defined in MSH-2. The default truncation character in a message is # (ASCII 35, HEX 23),because the character must come from the narrow range of allowed characters in an instance. The truncation character only represents truncation when it appears as the last character of a truncatable field. It SHALL be escaped if the last character of the data that is the maximum allowable size for the component is the truncation character.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>For a field with a conformance length of 5 where the content is |1234/P/| the truncation character is not representing truncation, it is the actual data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The selection of # as truncation character is taken from ISO 22220 and 27527.</p>
<h4 id="conformance-length-1">Conformance Length</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If populated, the conformance length column specifies the minimum length that applications must be able to store. Conformant applications SHALL NOT truncate a value that is shorter than the length specified. The conformance length is also the minimum value that maybe assigned to maximum length in an implementation profile.</p>
<p>In addition, the conformance length MAY be followed by a “=” or a “#”. The “=” denotes the value MAY never be truncated, and the “#” denotes that the truncation behaviour defined for the data type applies.</p>
<p>Applications are not required to implement the truncation pattern, even if it can be applied to an item. Applications SHOULD declare their adoption of the truncation pattern in their conformance profiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="type-and-componentfield-lengths">Type and Component/Field lengths</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Either normative or conformative lengths MAY be specified on a primitive data type. Whether or not normative or conformance lengths are specified on the data type, they MAY also be specified on the components and/or fields where the data type is used. If specified here, they override the length specified for the type (but must be consistent with the information on the type). If not specified, then the information specified on the data type itself – if present – applies where the data type is used.</p>
<p>Minimum and maximum lengths are not assigned for composite data types (data types having more than one component). Not only can the minimum or maximum lengths be indeterminate, it is misleading to report a length with separator characters included, and also misleading to associate a length with a composite component that must be broken up when it is stored. For these reasons derived lengths are not reported in this standard, though implementers MAY derive them as desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="implications-for-implementers">Implications for Implementers</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In an ideal world, the standard would be able to determine the maximum length for a value with authority, and all implementations would be able to handle the maximum length. However neither of these are true, and so this specification defines both normative maximum length, conformance length, and whether a value MAY be truncated. This following table summarises how these various parameters interact, provides an example of each combination, and outlines the implications for implementations. The second data type listed refers to the underlying data type the cited one is based upon.</p>

<h2 id="message-construction-rules">Message construction rules </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section addresses HL7 general rules for composing messages. Both the sender and receiver of the data must have predictable rules for how they will process the data. The reader is also referred to Section 2.B, "Conformance Using Message Profiles", where procedures for ensuring messaging integrity are discussed in detail.</p>
<p>In constructing a message, certain special characters are used. They are the segment terminator, the field separator, the component separator, subcomponent separator, repetition separator, escape character and the truncation character. The segment terminator is always a carriage return (in ASCII 13, hex 0D).The other delimiters are defined in the MSH segment, with the field delimiter in the 4th character position, and the other delimiters occurring as in the field called Encoding Characters, which is the first field after the segment ID. The delimiter values used in the MSH segment are the delimiter values used throughout the entire message. In the absence of other considerations, HL7 recommends the suggested values found in Figure 2-1 delimiter values.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These message construction rules define the standard HL7 encoding rules, creating variable length delimited messages. Although only one set of encoding rules has been defined as a standard since HL7 Version 2.3, other encoding rules are possible (but since they are non-standard, they MAY only be used by a site-specific agreement).</p>

Depending on device characteristics and application style considerations, the receiving application MAY choose reverse video, boldface, underlining, blink, an alternate color or another means of highlighting the displayed data. For example the message fragment:</p>
<p>DSP| TOTAL CHOLESTEROL \H\240*\N\ [90 - 200]</p>
<p>might cause the following data to appear on a screen or report:</p>
<p>TOTAL CHOLESTEROL 240* [90 - 200]</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><blockquote>
<p>The descriptive text name of a message or message constituent (except for segment group name) MAY be changed. This is not expected to have impact on either the sender's ability to transmit a message or the receiver's ability to receive and understand the message. Reasons for changing the descriptive text name include: 1) clarify a misleading name, and 2) encompassing a broader use without jeopardizing current use.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The data type of a field or data type component MAY be changed. A sending system SHOULD be able to send the modified field or data type; the receiver, regardless of its version level, SHOULD be able to understand the message and to ignore any message constituent it is not expecting.</p></li>

<li><p>The data type of the field MAY be changed provided that the components of the new data type have the same structure and interpretation as the old data type. For example, an IS data type MAY be changed to a CE, but a PPN data type cannot be changed to a PN. An NM data type cannot be changed to an ST data type.</p></li>
<li><p>For existing fields in existing segments, data types MAY be changed if the leftmost (prior version) part of the field has the same meaning as it had in the prior version of HL7. This is in accordance with the rules governing the addition of new components and subcomponents described in the section above. In other words, if the new parts of the field (those that are part of the new data type) are ignored, what remains is the old field (defined by the old data type), which has the same meaning as it had in the prior version of HL7.</p></li>
<li><p>If a data type component has its data type changed, the structure and interpretation SHALL remain the same as the pre-existing component. Any new component is added at the end of the data type.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>The optionality of a message constituent MAY be changed. A sending system SHOULD be able to send the modified field; the receiver, regardless of its version level, SHOULD be able to understand the message. This pertains as follows:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Existing optional segment groups MAY be made required.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing optional segments MAY be made conditional or required.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing optional fields MAY be made conditional or required.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing required fields MAY be made conditional if a new trigger event has been applied. The condition must be specified such that the field remains required for the pre-existing trigger events.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing optional components of a data type MAY be made conditional or required.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li><p>The repeatability of a message constituent MAY be changed. A sending system SHOULD be able to send the modified message constituent; the receiver, regardless of its version level, SHOULD be able to understand the message. Note that if a non-repeating message constituent is made repeating, information sent in the new repetitions couldbe lost to the recipient who is not expecting them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If HL7 has given, or will give, semantic meaning to the first instance, to allow backward compatibility, the first instance of the repeating constituent SHALL have the same meaning as the non-repeating constituent had in the prior version of HL7. In this way, a receiving application that interprets the message based upon the prior standard would continue to find the same intent communicated in the message.</p>
<p>If HL7 has not given, and will/can not give, semantic meaning to the first instance, and one or more implementation-applied business rules exist to select one of several occurrences to populate a non-repeating constituent, those same rules SHOULD be applied when a newer version of the standard allows for repetition of the constituent. By applying the prior business rules to determine the first occurrence of a repeating constituent, a receiving application that interprets the message based upon the prior standard would continue to find the same intent communicated in the message.</p>
<p>If, in the judgment of the owner/author of the standard section in question, changing a message constituent from non-repeating to repeating poses logical, parsing, business, or other compatibility issues, the owner/author SHOULD create a new structure to eliminate the compatibility concern.</p>
<p>For example, if allowing a segment to repeat implies a change to the business intent of the message, the work group(s) responsible SHOULD define a new message structure (as a new message/trigger) and retain the old structure for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>This pertains as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A segment group MAY change from non-repeating to repeating, subject to the backward compatibility concerns expressed above.</p></li>

<h3 id="deprecating-messages-or-message-constituents">Deprecating messages or message constituents</h3>
<p>Any required, optional or conditional constituent of an HL7 message, including the message itself, MAY be deprecated. This means that one of the following situations has occurred:</p>

<p>The fact of deprecation SHOULD NOT affect either the sender or the receiver because the message or message constituent is retained for backward compatibility. Implementers, by site agreement, MAY agree to not support deprecated message constituents.</p>

<p>A message or message constituent MAY be removed from the standard when criteria described in this section are met. HL7 will track old names so they are not re-used.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To refer to the detail of a withdrawn message constituent, the reader will need to review the appropriate earlier version of the standard. By site agreement senders and receivers MAY agree to continue to use messages and/or message constituents that have been removed.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A message constituent MAY be immediately removed from the standard based on the following criteria (immediately means in the same version in which the criteria are met.).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A message structure MAY be removed immediately provided no message references it in the standard. Care must be taken lest a message structure is prematurely removed if the associated trigger event that contributed to its name is removed. For example, if a message structure ABC_D01 is associated with trigger events D01, D02 and D03 and D01 is changed and becomes associated with another existing message structure DEF_E01, the message structure ABC_D01 is still active and valid for trigger events D02 and D03.</p></li>
<li><p>A segment MAY be removed immediately provided no message references it in the standard.</p></li>
<li><p>A data type MAY be removed immediately provided no fields reference it. This occurs when the data type for a field is changed to a new data type that incorporates the components of the old one.</p></li>

<h2 id="message-processing-rules">Message Processing Rules </h2>
<p>The processing rules described here apply to all exchanges of messages, whether or not the HL7 encoding rules or Lower Layer Protocols are used. They represent the primary message processing mode. The user MAY use either the original processing rules, described in section <em>2.9.2</em>, "<em>Message response using the original processing rules</em>", or -the enhanced processing rules, described in section <em>2.9.3</em>, "<em>Response using enhanced acknowledgment</em>" . The original mode and the enhanced mode serve different purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The MCF – Delayed Acknowledgment message has been removed from the standard. It was deprecated in v 2.2. Accordingly, the narrative notes regarding deferred processing have been removed from this section.</p>
<p>Certain variants exist and are documented elsewhere:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>an optional sequence number protocol. Refer to section <em>2.10.1</em>, "<em>Sequence number protocol</em>".</p></li>
<li><p>an optional protocol for continuing a very long message. Refer to section <em>2.10.2</em>, "<em>Continuation messages and segments</em>".</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the protocol describes an exchange of messages, it is described in terms of two entities, the initiating and responding systems. Each is both a sender and receiver of messages. The initiating system sends first and then receives, while the responding system receives and then sends.</p>
<p>In overview this exchange proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>Certain other fields in the MSH segment are required for the operation of the HL7 encoding rules; they will not be relevant if other encoding rules are employed.</p>
<p>The event code in the second component of <a href="#_MSH-9___Message Type  (MSG)   00009">MSH-9 Message Type</a> is redundantly shown elsewhere in some messages. For example, the same information is in the EVN segment of the ADT message. This is for compatibility with prior versions of the HL7 protocol.

<h2 id="special-hl7-protocols">Special HL7 Protocols</h2>
<p>This section contains several extensions to the basic HL7 message protocol. These extensions represent implementation choices, and are to be used on a site-specific and application-specific basis as needed.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-number-protocol">Sequence number protocol</h3>
<p>For certain types of data transactions between systems the issue of keeping databases synchronized is critical. An example is an ancillary system such as lab, which needs to know the locations of all inpatients to route stat results correctly. If the lab receives an ADT transaction out of sequence, the census/location information could be incorrect. Although it is true that a simple one-to-one acknowledgment scheme can prevent out-of-sequence transactions between any two systems, only the use of sequence numbers can prevent duplicate transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although this sequence number protocol is limited to the use of sequence numbers on a single transaction stream between two applications, this sequencing protocol is sufficiently robust to allow the design of HL7-compatible store-and-forward applications.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>initial conditions:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the system receiving the data stream is expected to store the sequence number of the most recently accepted transaction in a secure fashion before acknowledging that transaction. This stored sequence number allows comparison with the next transaction's sequence number, and the implementation of fault-tolerant restart capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>the initiating system keeps a queue of outgoing transactions indexed by the sequence number. The length of this queue must be negotiated as part of the design process for a given link. The minimum length for this queue is one.</p></li>
<li><p>the sequence number is a positive (non-zero) integer; and it is incremented by one (by the initiating system) for each successive transaction.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>starting the link:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the value of 0 (zero) for a sequence number is reserved: it is allowed only when the initiating system (re-)starts the link.</p></li>
<li><p>if the receiving system gets a transaction with a 0 (zero) in the sequence number field, it SHOULD respond with a general acknowledgment message whose MSA contains a sequence number one greater than the sequence number of the last transaction it accepted in the Expected Sequence Number field. If this value does not exist (as on the first startup of a given link), the MSA SHOULD contain a sequence number of -1, meaning that the receiving system will use the positive, non-zero sequence number of the first transaction it accepts as its initial sequence number (see re-synching the link, item e below).</p></li>
<li><p>the initiating system then sends the transaction indexed by the expected sequence number (if that expected transaction is still on its queue). Otherwise the link is frozen until an operator intervenes.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>normal operation of the link:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As it accepts each transaction, the receiving system securely stores the sequence number (which agrees with its expected sequence number), and then acknowledges the message by echoing the sequence number in <a href="#_MSA-4___Expected Sequence Number  (">MSA-4 Expected Sequence Number</a>.</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li><p>error conditions (from point of view of initiating system). These are generated by the receiving system, by its comparison of the sequence number sent out (with the MSH in <a href="#_MSH-13___Sequence Number  (NM)   00">MSH-13 Sequence Number</a>) with the expected sequence number (<a href="#_MSA-4___Expected Sequence Number  (">MSA-4 Expected Sequence Number</a> received with the MSA).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>expected sequence number is one greater than current value. The previous acknowledgment was lost. That transaction was sent again. Correct by sending next transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>expected sequence number less than current value. Initiating system can try starting again by issuing a transaction with a sequence number of zero; or freeze the link for operator intervention.</p></li>
<li><p>other errors: freeze the link for operator intervention</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="a">
<li><p>forcing resynchronization of sequence numbers across the link. The value of -1 for a sequence number is reserved: it is allowed only when the initiating system is re-synchronizing the link. Thus if the receiving system gets a value of -1 in the sequence number field, it SHOULD return a general acknowledgment message with a -1 in the expected sequence number field. The receiving system then resets its sequence number, using the non-zero positive sequence number of the next transaction it accepts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: When the initiating system sends a message with a sequence number of 0 or -1 (see b or e above), the segments beyond the MSH need not be present in the message, or, if present, all fields MAY be empty or unpopulated. In terms of the responding system, for these two cases, only a General acknowledgment message is needed.</strong></p>
<h3 id="continuation-messages-and-segments">Continuation messages and segments</h3>
<p>Sometimes, implementation limitations require that large messages or segments be broken into manageable chunks. We use the term "fragmentation" to describe how a logical message is broken into one or more separate HL7 messages. HL7 consciously identifies two situations where this MAY happen.</p>
<p>First, a single segment mightbe too large. HL7 uses the "ADD" segment to handle breaking a single segment into several smaller segments.</p>
<p>Second, a single HL7 message might be too large. HL7 uses the DSC segment and the continuation protocol to handle message fragmentation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: HL7 does not define what "too large" means. Acceptable values are subject to site negotiations.</p>
<p>See chapter 5 for a discussion of the continuation pointer segment and the continuation pointer field, and their use in the continuation of responses to queries and in the continuation of unsolicited update messages.</p>
<h4 id="segment-fragmentationcontinuation-using-the-add-segment">Segment fragmentation/continuation using the ADD segment</h4>
<p>Beginning with version 2.4, the ADD segment can be used <span class="underline">within</span> a message to break a long segment into shorter segments within a single HL7 message.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unless some explicit agreement exists between systems, a receiving application SHOULD NOT infer semantic meaning from the placement of the ADD segment.</p>
<p>To break a large segment,</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the segment being continued (call it ANY for this example) is ended at an arbitrary character position and terminated with the standard segment terminator (carriage return).</p></li>
<li><p>the following segment is the ADD segment. All characters after the ADD and field separator ("|") are logically part of the preceding segment. All succeeding consecutive ADD segments contribute characters to the ANY segment until a non ADD segment is found.</p></li>
<li><p>an ADD segment with no field separator takes on special meaning. See Section <a href="#segment-fragmentation-across-messages"><em>2.10.2.3</em></a>, "<a href="#segment-fragmentation-across-messages"><em>Segment fragmentation across messages</em></a>".</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, segment "C" can be fragmented within an HL7 message as follows:</p>
<p>A|1</p>
<p>B|2</p>
<p>C|34</p>
<p>ADD|5|678|</p>
<p>ADD|90</p>
<p>D|1</p>
<p>This is logically the same as</p>

<p>C|345|678|90</p>
<p>D|1</p>
<h4 id="segment-fragmentationcontinuation-using-the-dsc-segment">Segment fragmentation/continuation using the DSC segment</h4>
<p>When a message itself must be fragmented and sent as several HL7 messages, the DSC segment is used.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>First, the logical message is broken after an arbitrary segment.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, a DSC segment is sent. The <a href="#_DSC-1___Continuation Pointer (ST)  ">DSC-1 Continuation Pointer</a> field will contain a unique value that is used to match a subsequent message with this specific value.</p></li>
<li><p>The DSC terminates the first fragment of the logical message.</p></li>
<li><p>A subsequent message will contain in <a href="#_MSH-14___Continuation Pointer  (ST)">MSH-14 Continuation Pointer</a>, a value that matches the value from DSC-1. (The presence of a value in MSH-14 indicates that the message is a fragment of an earlier message.). Each subsequent message will have its own unique value for <a href="#_MSH-10___Message Control ID  (ST)  ">MSH-10 Message Control ID</a>. Coordination between <a href="#_DSC-1___Continuation Pointer (ST)  ">DSC-1 Continuation Pointer</a> and the subsequent message's <a href="#_MSH-14___Continuation Pointer  (ST)">MSH-14 Continuation Pointer</a> is used to link the fragments in their proper order.</p></li>
<li><p>The logical message is the concatenation of the contents of the first message (which while having no value in MSH-14, did end with DSC, and hence was actually a message fragment), plus all subsequent fragments (as identified by values in MSH-14).</p></li>
<li><p>If enhanced mode acknowledgments are used to request an accept ACK, then the receiver will acknowledge each fragment with an ACK message. Since each fragment has its own Message Control ID, each fragment level accept ACK will use the Message Control ID from the fragment it is acknowledging.</p></li>
<li><p>If enhanced mode acknowledgments are used to request an application level ACK, then the receiver will send an acknowledgment after receiving the final fragment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The application level ACK SHOULD refer to the message by the Message Control ID of the first fragment.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The receiver can tell that a given incoming message is a fragment by the presence of the trailing DSC. Subsequent HL7 messages are identified as fragments by the presence of an MSH-14 value. The presence of a DSC in a fragment indicates that more fragments are to follow.</p>
<p>It is a protocol error to end a message with DSC, and then never send a fragment.</p>
<p>For example, a single logical message MAY be fragmented into three HL7 messages:</p>
<p>---- Sender HL7 message (incomplete,fragment1)---</p>
<p>MSH|||||||||1001||2.4|123||..</p>
<p>A|...</p>
<p>B|...</p>
<p>DSC|W4xy</p>
<p>---- Sender HL7 message (fragment 2)---</p>
<p>MSH|||||||||2106||2.4|124|W4xy|</p>
<p>C|...</p>
<p>D|...</p>
<p>DSC|V292</p>
<p>----- another HL7 message(fragment 3, final)---</p>
<p>MSH|||||||||2401||2.4|125|V292</p>
<p>E|...</p>
<p>Such a sequence is logically the same as the single message:</p>
<p>MSH|...|2.4|123||..</p>
<p>A|...</p>
<p>B|...</p>
<p>C|...</p>
<p>D|...</p>
<p>E|...</p>
<p>See example in section <em>2.1.1</em> for a more elaborate example.</p>
<h4 id="segment-fragmentation-across-messages">Segment fragmentation across messages</h4>
<p>If the last segment of a fragment itself needs to be broken, then the following idiomatic use of ADD SHALL apply.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the segment being continued (call it ANY for this example) is ended at an arbitrary character position and terminated with the standard segment terminator (carriage return).</p></li>
<li><p>the following segment is the ADD segment. It will contain no characters other than "ADD". (The lack of characters signals the receiver that ANY will be continued.)</p></li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<p>The sequence numbering protocol has a natural application in batch transfers. See the discussion of batch acknowledgments that follows.</p>
<p>Although a batch will usually consist of a single type of message, there is nothing in the definition that restricts a batch to only one message type.</p>
<p>The HL7 file and batch header and trailer segments are defined in exactly the same manner as the HL7 message segments. Hence the HL7 message construction rules of Sections <em>2.5.5</em> and <em>2.6</em>, can be used to encode and decode HL7 batch files.</p>
<p>There are only two cases in which an HL7 batch file MAY contain zero HL7 messages:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>a batch containing zero HL7 messages MAY be sent to meet a requirement for periodic submission of batches when there are no messages to send.</p></li>
<li><p>a batch containing zero negative acknowledgment messages MAY be sent to indicate that all the HL7 messages contained in the batch being acknowledged are implicitly acknowledged. See Section <em>2.10.3.2</em>, "<em>Acknowledging batches</em>."</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To better understand, why security labels MAY be applicable to batch files, we provide the following use case:</p>
<p>Some HIEs (likely a majority of US HIEs) push ADTs to HIE participants authorized to receive these under HIPAA. Some consider payers to be authorized to receive ADTs under HIPAA (despite the fact that ADTs are for treatment purposes and should likely only be going to providers.)</p>
<p>If 1..*of the ADTs included in 1..* BSH within a FSH contains an ADT with security label indicating that this information is not to be disclosed to payer X based on patient right under HIPAA to restrict because the patient paid for services in full out of pocket, then the HIE SHOULD NOT automatically send the entire FSH to the payers it would otherwise send it to,</p>
<p>The HIE would need to parse the FSH to find the 1..* BSH with security label = do not disclose to payer X. It could then send any of the other BSH on to payers as usual.</p>
<p>It would then parse the 1..* BSH with security label = do not disclose to payer X to find the 1..*MSH with the security label = do not disclose to payer X, and then send those MSH to the payers besides payer X.</p>
<h4 id="related-segments-and-data-usage">Related segments and data usage</h4>
<p>The following segments relate to the HL7 Batch Protocol:</p>
<p>BHS Batch Header (See section <em>2.14.2</em>)</p>
<p>BTS Batch Trailer (See section <em>2.14.3</em>)</p>
<p>FHS File Header (See section <em>2.14.6</em>)</p>
<p>FTS File Trailer (See section <em>2.14.7</em>)</p>
<p>The BTS segment contains a field, <a href="#_BTS-3___Batch Totals  (NM)   00095">BTS-3 Batch Totals</a>, which MAY have one or more totals drawn from fields within the individual messages. The method for computing such totals will be determined on a site or application basis unless explicitly stated in a functional chapter.</p>
<h4 id="acknowledging-batches">Acknowledging batches</h4>
<p>In general, the utility of sending batches of data is that the data is accepted all at once, with errors processed on an exception basis. However, it is a permissible application of HL7 to acknowledge all messages. Several options for acknowledgment are given and will be chosen on an application basis. In these cases, the sequence numbering protocol can be useful to the applications processing the batch.</p>
<p>The options are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>all messages are acknowledged in the response batch.</p></li>
<li><p>the receiving system prints some form of batch control report, which is then dealt with manually by personnel at the sending system. No acknowledgments are performed by the protocol software.</p></li>
<li><p>an automated acknowledgment batch is created containing acknowledgment messages only for those messages containing errors. In this mode an empty acknowledgment batch MAY be created (i.e., an HL7 batch file without any HL7 acknowledgment messages).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In each case where there is a response batch, its format is a batch of individual messages. Each individual message is in the format defined for an online response in the chapters. Consider, for example, a batch that might be constructed to respond to a batch of Detailed Financial Transactions (Chapter 6). The messages in the response batch would consist entirely of ACK messages, since ACK is the response shown in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>When batches are retransmitted after the correction of errors, <a href="#_BHS-12___Reference Batch Control ID">BHS-12 Reference Batch Control ID</a> SHOULD contain the batch control ID of the original batch.</p>
<h4 id="batch-message-as-a-query-response">Batch message as a query response</h4>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The QRD and QRF segments were retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.4. The reader is referred to chapter 5, section 5.4, for the current query/response message structure.</p>
<p>The HL7 query also can be used to query for a batch in the following manner:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>use the B in ResponseModality field of the RCP segment. The query will be acknowledged with a general acknowledgment as in the Deferred Access example above (see chapter 5)</p></li>
<li><p>in addition, insert into the batch file the QRD and QRF segments as follows:</p></li>

<h3 id="protocol-for-interpreting-repeating-segments-or-segment-groups-in-an-update-message">Protocol for interpreting repeating segments or segment groups in an update Message </h3>
<p>This section describes the protocol for interpreting repeating segments or segment groups in an update message. Common examples of repeating segments are NK1 and OBX shown as [{NK1}] and [{OBX}] in the abstract message syntax. Common examples of segment groups are displayed as {ORC RXO [{RXC}]} or [{IN1 [IN2] [{IN3}]}] in the abstract message syntax</p>
<p>There are 2 methods of update: the "snapshot" and the "action code/unique identifier" modes. These are defined in sections 2.10.4.1 and 2.10.4.2 below.</p>
<p>If a particular repeating segment can be updated by either of these two modes, the parties concerned will determine by agreement among messaging partners whether an interface will use the "snapshot" mode or the "action code/unique identifier" mode.</p>
<p>Both the sender and receiver of the data must have predictable rules for how they will process the data in repeating segments or segment groups regardless of which mode is used. This SHOULD be documented in the Conformance Profile. It is critical to know, for instance, if the Sender is the System of Record.</p>
<h4 id="hiddentext">hiddentext</h4>
<h4 id="snapshot-mode-update-definition">Snapshot mode update definition </h4>
<p>For segments that do not contain unique identifiers and action codes (mainly NTE and patient administration segments), the only option is to treat the information in the repeating segments and segment groups as a whole.</p>
<p>When an HL7 abstract message syntax includes these repeating units or sets, there is no implicit indication of how they interact with a similar set in a prior or subsequent message. Interpretation is not obvious from the message syntax particularly if the requirement is to update only part of the information previously sent.</p>
<p>The existence of a segment, and possibly the lack of existence of a segment, might serve to add, update, replace, or delete information passed in similar segments in prior messages. Special consideration is warranted in the case where multiple instances of a segment exist in a message.</p>
<p>In the “snapshot” mode, a group of repeating segments from the incoming message replaces the prior group of repeating segments on the receiving system. This is equivalent to a deletion of the prior group followed by the addition of the new group.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion when all of the segments in a repeating group are to be deleted, one must send a single segment with “delete data” indicated for the first field (or all fields) of the segment to indicate that all information related to the segment is to be deleted.  In this scenario, snapshot mode provides for deleting the prior group of repeating segment data on the receiving system.  Otherwise, sending no segment(s) at all without such explicit indication could lead the receiver to assume nothing was changed, thus not sent.  I.e., if no segment is sent, this equates to "no information." No information SHOULD NOT signal the receiver to take an action, i.e. no action SHOULD be taken on any of the data related to the prior group of repeating segments.</p>
<p>Since messages MAY contain multiple, possibly nested, groups, it is critically important to understand the level at which group(s) are subject to snapshot mode, especially the delete functionality outlined above. For example, a results message MAY include results for multiple patients, or a charge batch MAY include charges for multiple patients. Whether snapshot, and especially delete, applies to all the patients in the entire message, all the order-observations within one patient, or all the observations within one order-observation group must be agreed to by the trading partners, or otherwise specified in a conformance profile and/or the section-specific chapters of the HL7 Standard.</p>
<p>To support assertions made in some chapters, e.g., chapter 6, and common practice at implementation sites, as of v2.6, the signal methods have been extended. By agreement among messaging partners or Conformance Profile, a sender might opt to signal deletion of data in the following manner:</p>
<p>Transmit the delete indicator only:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in the key identifier field if the segment has an explicit one – all other fields have no data</p></li>
<li><p>in the first field of the segment to indicate that all are to be deleted</p></li>
<li><p>in any combination of fields that the Sender customarily sends to the recipient - all other fields have no data</p></li>
<li><p>in all required fields all – all other fields have no data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This obviates the need for the Sender to populate fields ordinarily not sent and not expected by the receiver.</p>
<h5 id="snapshot-mode-and-repeating-segments---example">Snapshot Mode and Repeating Segments - Example</h5>
<p>Example A: if a patient record indicated a 2 sisters and a brother as next of kin, this would be represented as follows in the add person/patient information message:</p>
<p>MSH||||||||ADT^A28^ADT_A05|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PID|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>NK1|1|Nuclear^Nancy^D|SIS^Sister^HL70063|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>NK1|2|Nuclear^Nelda^W|SIS^Sister^HL70063|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>NK1|3|Nuclear^Neville^S|BRO^Brother^HL70063|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PV1|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>If, subsequently, the one of the sisters was delisted as next of kin, it would be necessary to send both the remaining "brother" and "sister" records in order to form a complete replacement set in an update person information message:</p>
<p>MSH|||||||||ADT^A31^ADT_A05|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PID|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>NK1|1|Nuclear^Nancy^D|SIS^Sister^HL70063|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>NK1|2|Nuclear^Neville^S|BRO^Brother^HL70063|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PV1|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>If all next of kin were to be subsequently delisted, an update message with a single delete indicator populated segment would instruct the receiving system to delete information represented by any prior set:</p>
<p>MSH||||||||ADT^A31^ADT_A05|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...</p>
<p>PID|...</p>
<p>NK1|""|""|""|""|&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PV1|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>Alternatively, as of v2.6, the deletion could be signaled by sending a delete indicatorin the first field of the NK1 segment. This is its only required field.</p>
<p>MSH||||||||ADT^A31^ADT_A05|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...</p>
<p>PID|...</p>
<p>NK1|""|&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PV1|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<h5 id="snapshot-mode-and-repeating-segment-groups">Snapshot Mode and Repeating Segment Groups</h5>
<p>Treatment of the repeating segment group is analogous to the handling of the repeating segment described above. To indicate deletion of all of the information in a repeating segment group, it is only necessary to delete the anchoring segment of the segment group. This is accomplished just as described above for deleting a repeating segment. This pertains to segments governed by snapshot mode, not action code.</p>
<p>Example: An account is created for Adam Everyman. He is insured under plan ID A357 with an insurance company known to both systems as BCMD, with a company ID of 1234. He is also covered by his wife's insurance under plan ID A789 with an insurance company known to both systems as VGMC, with a company ID of 6789.</p>
<p>MSH||||||||BAR^P01^BAR_P01|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|</p>
<p>PID|</p>
<p>IN1|1|A357|1234|BCMD</p>

<p>IN3|</p>
<p>IN1|2|A789|6789|VGMC</p>
<p>IN2|</p>
<p>IN3|</p>
<p>Subsequently it is learned that his wife has changed insurance plans. Her new plan is now C45. The insurance company and company ID have remained the same. A BAR^P05 might be sent.</p>
<p>MSH||||||||BAR^P05^BAR_P05|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|</p>
<p>PID|</p>
<p>IN1|1|A357|1234|BCMD</p>

<p>IN3|</p>
<p>IN1|2|C45|6789|VGMC</p>
<p>IN2|</p>
<p>IN3|</p>
<p>It is later discovered that the patient is not covered by either plan and now has no insurance at all. A BAR^P05 is again sent. In accordance with chapter 6, this can be signaled by showing delete indicator in the plan field.</p>
<p>MSH||||||||BAR^P05^BAR_P05|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|</p>
<p>PID|</p>
<p>IN1|""|""</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the patient still had his coverage, and only the wife's insurance had been dropped, a fully populated IN1 segment group would be transmitted. The presence of only one IN1 in a subsequent message conveys the "full group replacement" notion. The BAR^P05 would be transmitted and would be interpreted to mean "retain plan A357; delete and other plans":</p>
<p>MSH||||||||BAR^P05^BAR_P05|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|</p>
<p>PID|</p>

<h4 id="action-codeunique-identifier-mode-update-definition">Action code/unique identifier mode update definition</h4>
<p>In the "action code/unique identifier" mode (action code mode), each member of a segment or segment group can be acted upon independently of the other members. Thus, it is possible to delete or update a member of the set without including the other members of the set. The choice of delete/update/insert is determined by the action code (or an equivalent such as result status in an ORU Observation Report message). Refer to <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70206"><em>HL7 Table 0206 - Segment Action Code</em></a> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.</p>
<p>The <em>unique identifier</em> unambiguously identifies one of multiple repetitions of the repeating segment or segment group in a way that does not change over time. It is not dependent on any particular message identifier level (MSH) fields; it functions across messages, not just within a message. For a single segment repetition, the <em>unique identifier</em> MAY be an explicit field (e.g., IAM-7 Allergy Unique Identifier) or a combination of fields (IAM suggests IAM-3 Allergen Identifier in the context of the particular patient). For a repeating segment group, an identifier in the anchoring segment would identify the repeating set. For MFN messages, MFI-1 Master File Identifier and MFE-4 Primary Key Value identify the particular table and record.</p>
<p>Example 1: If a patient is allergic to penicillin and shellfish, the following message would be sent showing an Action code of "A(dd) in IAM-6:</p>
<p>MSH|||||||||ADT^A60^ADT_A60|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PID|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>IAM|1||peni|||A&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>IAM|2||shell||A&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>Subsequently, if it is learned that the patient is not allergic to shellfish, the following message would be sent showing an Action code of "D(elete) in IAM-6:</p>
<p>MSH|||||||||ADT^A60^ADT_A60|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PID|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>IAM|1||shell||D&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>Some messages, Orders and Observations, in particular, do not use table 0206. Order control codes are used to unambiguously specify the action to be taken.</p>
<p>Example 2: if a set of orders had been sent as</p>
<p>MSH|||||||||OML^O21^OML_O21|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PID|...</p>
<p>ORC|NW|987654^CIS|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>ORC|NW|876543^CIS|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>

<h3 id="protocol-for-interpreting-repeating-fields-in-an-update-message">Protocol for interpreting repeating fields in an update message </h3>
<p>With repeating fields, the segment action codes are not relevant. Action codes cannot be applied to individual field repetitions, because they cannot be uniquely identified. Therefore, they must all be there, i.e., send a full list for each transaction. If the intent is to delete an element, it is left off the list. This is analogous to the snapshot mode for repeating segments and segment groups. If the intent is to delete the whole list, the field is transmitted once with a delete indicator in the first component. In effect, the Sender must make a statement about what action the receiver is expected to take: omitting, or not populating, the field is not a clear signal according to field state definition as described in section 2.5.3.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is not incorrect to be precise about specific information that is to be deleted if the data type supports this capability. Note, however, that data types without components, e.g., ID or ST do not support this capability. There is no way to tie the delete indicator to an actual element instance in the persistent data store. See the example below.</p>
<p>Special consideration is warranted when implementing multiple interfaces. While the same processing rules (snapshot or update) can be applied to multiple systems and interfaces, desynchronization can occur if any one system is receiving similar information from multiple sources. Business rules and processes need to be considered in these cases to determine if there is a single authoritative source for the information (a "System of Record"), or if other business logic exists to resolve the possibility that information from the two (or more) sources are not in agreement.</p>
<p>Example: Repeating field of data type ID: A patient is added to the Master Patient Index. The patient has two specific living conditions: "spouse dependent" and "medical supervision required". This is transmitted as:</p>
<p>MSH|^~\&amp;||||||||ADT^A28^ADT_A05|1|P|2.7...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PID|||1234567^^^^MRN| &lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PV1|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PD1|S~M|</p>
<p>Subsequently, the "medical supervision required" living condition is dropped.</p>
<p>MSH|^~\&amp;||||||||ADT^A31^ADT_A31|1|P|2.7...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>EVN|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PID|||1234567^^^^MRN|&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PV1|...&lt;cr&gt;</p>
<p>PD1|S||||||||||||||||||||||</p>
<p>The data type for PD1-1 is a data types without components. There is no way to tie the delete indicator to an actual element instance in the persistent data store. Therefore the following is ambiguous and not good practice.</p>

<h2 id="local-extension">Local Extension</h2>
<p>The following section specifies where local extensions to a message and its constituent parts are allowed, where they are not, and where they are ill-advised. Inter-version compatibility rules must be followed plus there are certain restrictions and prohibitions outlined in the sections that follow. In general, basic structures SHOULD NOT be altered.</p>
<p>The reader is advised to review the Conformance mechanism defined in section 2B<em>,</em> "Conformance Using Message Profiles" before applying local extensions. Using the conformance mechanismighteliminate the need for local extension.</p>
<h3 id="messages-1">Messages</h3>
<p>Messages MAY be locally extended as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Users MAY develop local Z messages to cover areas not already covered by existing HL7 messages. These SHOULD be composed of HL7 segments where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>A local Z message MAY consist entirely of Z segments except that it SHALL begin with a MSH segment.</p></li>
<li><p>A local Z Acknowledgment message SHALL begin with an MSH segment followed by an MSA segment, an optional SFT segment and a conditional ERR segment.</p></li>
<li><p>Users MAY develop Z segments and add them to Z messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Users MAY develop Z segments and add them to HL7 messages. The trigger event MAY remain the same if the intent of the message has remained unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of adding additional HL7 segments, like NTE, to existing HL7 messages locally is ill-advised. HL7 MAY move or change the segment in a future release; this will render the message unparsible.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="trigger-events-1">Trigger events</h3>
<p>Users MAY develop local Z trigger events for messages.</p>
<h3 id="segment-groups">Segment groups</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The practice of turning a single segment or segments into a segment group locally <strong>SHALL NOT be</strong> allowed within an HL7 event. It will have a negative impact on XML and any component-based encoding schemes. Note that HL7, on other hand, can do this.</p></li>
<li><p>A segment group MAY NOT be ungrouped locally.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if there is an HL7 group as follows:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>ABC</p>
<p>[DEF</p>
<p>[GHI]]</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>one cannot change it in a local implementation to be as follows:</p>
<p>{[ABC]}</p>
<p>[DEF]</p>
<p>[GHI]</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>If the original definition was:</p>
<p>GROUP1 ::= ABC, GROUP2?</p>
<p>GROUP2 ::= DEF, GHI?</p>
<p>and someone wished to constrain the segments in GROUP2 to be mandatory</p>
<p>(i.e., the HL7 grammar would look like:</p>
<p>{[</p>
<p>ABC</p>
<p>DEF</p>
<p>[GHI]</p>
<p>]}</p>
<p>Their message instance would need to still look like:</p>
<p>&lt;GROUP1&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ABC/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;GROUP2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;DEF/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;GHI/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/GROUP2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/GROUP1&gt;</p>
<p>It would be an error if they instead sent it as:</p>
<p>&lt;GROUP1&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ABC/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;DEF/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;GHI/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/GROUP1&gt;</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>A segment group MAY repeat locally. The 1<sup>st</sup> repetition needs to mean what it does in HL7</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of incorporating a Z segment into a segment group locally <strong>is</strong> allowed.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="segments">Segments</h3>
<h4 id="local-extension-rules-for-segments">Local extension rules for segments</h4>
<p>Users SHALL NOT modify an existing segment, except as specified in section <em>2.8.2</em>, "<em>Changing messages or message constituents</em>".</p>
<p>Locally defined fields MAY be defined for use in locally defined segments, although HL7 defined fields are a better choice when available. The practice of extending an HL7 segment with locally defined fields, while not prohibited, is ill-advised.</p>
<p>HL7 also recognizes that sites MAY have locally defined fields where the users believe the enhancement might be of interest to the HL7 community as a whole and are moving forward with a proposal to HL7.</p>
<h4 id="caveats-for-locally-extending-segments">Caveats for locally extending segments</h4>
<p>Locally extending an HL7 segment with locally defined fields will likely cause conformance problems with the next release of the HL7 standard. There are, however, certain circumstances where HL7 has, itself, directed the membership to add Z fields as an interim measure between versions to accommodate regulatory agency requirements. These are fields that HL7 has reserved for official introduction in the next release.</p>
<p>If the local site intends to add a proposed field early, there is a risk that it might collide with another field when HL7 officially approves or rejects the proposed additions. Some sites have employed the practice of assigning a high sequence number locally, i.e., leaving a gap between the last official HL7 field and the proposed new field. The user–defined fields SHOULD be deleted or deprecated when HL7 officially approves or rejects the proposed additions so that the fields do not collide. It must be understood that the local implementation will have to adjust if a collision occurs and they want to conform.</p>
<h3 id="data-types">Data types</h3>
<p>The following rules apply for locally extending data types:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Locally defined data types MAY be defined for use in locally defined segment fields, although HL7 defined data types are a better choice when available.</p></li>
<li><p>Locally redefining existing data type components, e.g., changing a component from NM to ST, is prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>Data types MAY be locally extended by adding new components at the end. This action creates a Z data type.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The practice of extending an HL7 data type with locally defined components is particularly ill-advised and might cause conformance problems with the next release of the HL7 standard.</p>
<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
<p>Rules for locally extending tables are the same as discussed in section <em>2.5.3.7</em>, "<em>Table</em>":</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Users MAY redefine suggested values in User-defined tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Local tables MAY be defined for Z fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Local tables MAY be assigned to HL7 fields with data type CWE.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="fields-1">Fields</h3>
<p>Fields MAY be extended locally by the extension of data-types. See section 2.11.5, Data Types.</p>
<h3 id="message-representation">Message representation</h3>
<p>For each trigger event the messages that are exchanged when the trigger event occurs are defined using the HL7 abstract message syntax as follows:</p>
<p>Each message is defined in special notation that lists the segment IDs in the order they would appear in the message. Braces, { . . . }, indicate one or more repetitions of the enclosed group of segments. Of course, the group MAY contain only a single segment. Brackets, [ . . . ], show that the enclosed group of segments is optional. If a group of segments is optional and MAY repeat it SHALL be enclosed in brackets and braces, [{...}].</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> [{...}] and {[...]} are equivalent.</p>
<p>Whenever braces or brackets enclose more than one segment ID a special stylistic convention is used to help the reader understand the hierarchy of repetition. For example, the first segment ID appears on the same line as the brace, two columns to the right. The subsequent segment IDs appear under the first. The closing brace appears on a line of its own in the same column as the opening brace. This convention is an optional convenience to the user. If there is conflict between its use and the braces that appear in a message schematic, the braces define the actual grouping of segments that is permitted.</p>
<p>A choice of one segment from a group of segments is indicated by using angle brackets to delimit the group and vertical bar delimiters between the several segments.</p>
<p>Example: The following example allows a choice of segments :</p>
<p>&lt;ABC | DEF | GHI | JKL &gt;</p>
<p>Example: The following example allows a choice of segments and/or segment groups. (see Figure 2-5 Hypothetical schematic message)</p>
<p>The first choice is a repeating group consisting of an ABC segment followed by optionally repeating NTE segments.</p>
<p>The second choice is the DEF segment.</p>
<p>The third choice is a group with a required GHI segment followed by an optionally repeating group containing a PRT segment followed by an optionally repeating NTE segment.</p>
<p>&lt;{ABC [{NTE}] } |[DEF | GHI [{PRT [{NTE}] }] ] &gt;</p>

<p>Consider the hypothetical triggering event <strong>a widget report is requested</strong>. It might be served by the Widget Request (WRQ) and Widget Report (WRP) messages. These would be defined in the Widget chapter (say Chapter XX). The Widget Request message might consist of the following segments: Message Header (MSH), Software Segment (SFT), User Authentication Credentials (UAC), and Widget ID (WID). The Widget Report message might consist of the following segments: Message Header (MSH), Software Segment (SFT), Message acknowledgment (MSA), Error Segment (ERR) and one or more Widget Description (WDN) Segments each of which is followed by a single Widget Portion segment (WPN) followed by zero or more Widget Portion Detail (WPD) segments. The Widget group ends with the optional Inclusion group, which allows a choice of segments/groups.</p>
<p>The ADD and DSC segments follow special rules or protocol as defined in section 2.10.2. They are not represented in the message grammar in the domain chapters as their presence is context sensitive.</p>
<p>The schematic form for this hypothetical exchange of messages is shown in Figure 2-5:</p>

<h2 id="message-control-segments">Message Control Segments</h2>
<p>The following segments are necessary to support the functionality described in this chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The HL7 message construction rules define the standard HL7 encoding rules, creating variable length delimited messages from the segments defined below. Although only one set of encoding rules is defined as a standard in HL7 Version 2.3, other encoding rules are possible (but since they are non-standard, they MAY only used by a site-specific agreement).</p>
<p>The segments in this section are listed in alphabetical order. The following chart shows a summary of the segments listed by category.</p>

<p>Definition: This field is used to define the continuation of the prior segment in a continuation message. See section <em>2.10.2</em>, "<em>Continuation messages and segments</em>" for details. When the ADD is sent after the segment being continued, it contains no fields. It is only a marker that the previous segment is being continued in a subsequent message. Thus fields 1‑N are not present. The sequence designation, 1‑N, means the remainder of the fields in the segment being continued. These remainder of the segment being continued fields are present only when the ADD is sent with a continuation message.</p>

<h3 id="err-error-segment">ERR ‑ error segment </h3>
<p>The ERR segment is used to add error comments to acknowledgment messages.</p>
<p>Use Cases:</p>
<p>Severity: A receiving application needs to communicate 2 "error or exception statements." One is an "error;" the other is a "warning". To accomplish this, an acknowledgment message with 2 ERR segments is sent. Upon receipt, the sending application can display both, including the appropriate severity, to the user.</p>
<p>Application Error Code: A receiving application generates an error that reports an application error code and returns this information in its response. This code in turn is used by helpdesk staff to pinpoint the exact cause of the error, or by the application to prompt an appropriate response from the user. (Ex. Deceased date must be greater than or equal to birth date).</p>
<p>Application Error Parameter: A receiving application encounters an error during processing of a transaction. In addition to an error code, the application provides an error parameter that gives greater detail as to the exact nature of the error. The receiving application looks up the message corresponding to the error code, substitutes in the parameter, and displays the resulting message to the user.</p>
<p>Diagnostic Information: While processing a transaction, a receiving application encounters an exception. When the exception is thrown, it provides a volume of detailed information relating to the error encountered. The receiving application captures the information and sends it in its response. The user reports the error to the help desk, and on request, faxes a copy of the diagnostic information to assist analyzing the problem.</p>
<p>User Message: A user executes an application function that generates a transaction that is sent to another application for further processing. During this processing, the receiving application encounters an error and, as part of the error handling routine, retrieves a User Message that it returns in its response. The originating application receives the error and displays it to the end user with the intent that the error condition can be resolved and the user can re-execute the function without error.</p>
<p>Inform Person Code: After submitting a dispense transaction, a response is returned to the user indicating that the patient could be abusing drugs. Given the sensitivity of this warning, the error is returned with an indicator stating that the patient should not be informed of the error with the implication that steps should be taken to rule out or confirm the warning.</p>
<p>Override Type: If a business rule states that a prescription on hold cannot be dispensed, an override type might be "Dispense Held Prescription" to allow the prescription to be dispensed in exception to the rule.</p>
<p>Override Reason Codes: A patient is given a prescription; however, before completing the prescription, the remaining pills are spoiled. The patient returns to their pharmacy and explains the situation to their pharmacist. The pharmacist decides to replace the spoiled drugs; however, when attempting to record the event, a message is returned indicating that the dispense would exceed the maximum amount prescribed. The pharmacist overrides the rule and specifies an Override Reason Code indicating a replacement of lost product.</p>
<p>Help Desk Contact: Help desk contact information is stored in a database. When an application error is encountered, the database is queried and the most current help desk contact information is returned in the error message. This is displayed to the user by the receiving application.</p>
<p>Better Error Location Information: Receiving system detects an error with the 3rd repetition of the ROL.4 (Role Person - XCN).16 (Name Context – CE).4(Alternate Identifier – CWE). The application identifies the specific repetition and component when raising the error, simplifying diagnosis of the problem.</p>
<p>Support for multiple Error Locations: Two fields are marked as conditional, with the condition that one of the two must be specified. The sending application leaves both blank. The receiving application detects the problem, and sends back a single error indicating that one of the fields must be filled in. The ERR segment identifies both positions within the message that relate to the error.</p>

<p>Note: This field is used to declare the ‘high watermark’, meaning the most restrictive handling that needs to be applied to the message based on its content requiring a certain security classification level and SHOULD be viewed as the v2 equivalent of the document header in CDA, in v3 models, and in FHIR Security Labels on Resources and Bundles. The use of confidentiality codes to classify message content and its inclusion in the high water mark in the header of message content is -described in the Guide to the HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System, Release 1, which is platform independent.</p>
<p>Refer to <em>Externally-defined HL7 Table 0952 – HL7 Confidentiality Code</em> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. Use of this table is recommended. The codes in this table are comprehensive, non-overlapping hierarchical codes: Very Restricted &gt; Restricted &gt; Normal &gt; Moderate &gt; Low &gt; Unrestricted. Restrictions to a comprehensive, non-overlapping set of codes is required for purposes of access control system algorithms such as Bell–LaPadula Mode, which isl used to adjudicate access requests against privacy policies.</p>

<h4 id="msa-7-message-waiting-number-nm-01827">MSA-7 Message Waiting Number (NM) 01827</h4>
<p>Definition: If present, indicates the number of messages the Acknowledging Application has waiting on a queue for the Requesting Application. These messages would then need to be retrieved via a query. This facilitates receiving applications that cannot receive unsolicited message (i.e., polling).</p>
<p>For example, if there are 3 low priority messages, 1 medium priority message and 1 high priority message, the message waiting number would be 5, because that is the total number of messages.</p>
<p>Use Case: An application that is playing a "requesting" role has limited network access to a centralized application playing a receiving role. When the requesting application contacts the acknowledging application with a regular update or query message, the acknowledging application replies with the appropriate response message, along with an indication that there are urgent messages waiting. The requesting application submits a query to retrieve the queued messages.</p>
<h4 id="msa-8-message-waiting-priority-id-01828">MSA-8 Message Waiting Priority (ID) 01828</h4>
<p>Definition: If present, indicates that the Sending Application has messages waiting on a queue for the Receiving Application. These messages would then need to be retrieved via a query. This facilitates receiving applications that cannot receive unsolicited messages (i.e., polling). The code specified identifies how important the most important waiting message is (and can govern how soon the receiving application is required to poll for the message).</p>
<p>For example, if there are 3 low priority messages, 1 medium priority message and 1 high priority message, the message waiting priority would be 'high', because that is the highest priority of any message waiting.</p>
<p>With some applications, there is no guarantee that the sending application will be running. The receiving application is therefore unable to submit unsolicited messages. To mitigate this, a polling approach is used where the receiving application requests any queued messages when it is connected. To avoid the network overhead of continuous polling, the sending application needs a way to indicate that there are queued messages awaiting retrieval. It is also useful to provide an indication of the importance of those messages to indicate how quickly they must be retrieved.</p>

<p>Definition: This field is matched by the receiving system to its own version to be sure the message will be interpreted correctly. Beginning with Version 2.3.1, it has two additional "internationalization" components, for use by HL7 international affiliates. The &lt;internationalization code&gt; is CE data type (using the ISO country codes where appropriate) which represents the HL7 affiliate. The &lt;internal version ID&gt; is used if the HL7 Affiliate has more than a single 'local' version associated with a single US version. The &lt;international version ID&gt; has a CE data type, since the table values vary for each HL7 Affiliate.

The ISO 3166 table has three separate forms of the country code: HL7 specifies that the 3-character (alphabetic) form be used for the country code.</p>

<h4 id="msh-18-character-set-id-00692">MSH-18 Character Set (ID) 00692</h4>
<p>Definition: This field contains the character set for the entire message. Refer to <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70211"><em>HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets</em></a> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.</p>
<p>An HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70211"><em>HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets</em></a>. MSH-18 Character Set MAY be left blank, or MAY contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value MAY also be explicitly specified as <strong>ASCII</strong>.</p>
<p>More than one character set MAY be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 SHALL indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.</p>
<p>The repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section <em>2.7.3,</em> "<em>Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets</em>".</p>
<p>Any encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, MAY be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites SHALL document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.</p>
<p>By using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons SHOULD be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters SHOULD always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII ("ISO IR6")) SHOULD be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message.</p></li>
<li><p>if the field repeats, but the first element is empty(I.e. unvalued), the single-byte ASCII ("ISO IR6") is assumed as the default character set.</p></li>
<li><p>elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that MAY be used.</p></li>

<p>The reader is referred to the following references for background information on character sets and encodings:</p>
<p>Unicode Technical Report #17 - Character Encoding Model (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr17/">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr17/</a>)</p>

<h5 id="alphabetic-languages-other-than-english">Alphabetic Languages Other Than English</h5>
<p>The first occurrence of <a href="#_MSH-18___Character Set   (ID)   006">MSH-18 Character Set</a> MAY reference a character set other than 7-bit ASCII. Western alphabetic languages other than English are accommodated by the ISO 8859 series of character encodings. For example, if MSH-18 Character Set is valued <strong>8859/1</strong>, the ISO character set commonly known as "8-bit ASCII" is in use in the message. This includes all values from decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F), plus an additional 128 values from decimal 128 through decimal 255 (hex 80 through hex FF). The latter values include the accented Latin letters used in common Western European languages, plus some symbolic values such as the paragraph mark (¶) and the trademark symbol (™).</p>
<p>Other ISO character sets in the 8859 series accommodate non-Latin character sets. For example, MSH-18 Character Set could be valued <strong>8859/2</strong> to specify the default character encoding in use in Eastern Europe, while <strong>8859/6</strong> indicates the use of the Arabic alphabet.</p>
<p>The ASCII and ISO character sets all allow the specification of any character in a single byte.</p>
<h5 id="non-alphabetic-languages">Non-Alphabetic Languages</h5>
<p>HL7 Table 0211 includes values for languages that do not use alphabets. These include ideographic written languages, such as the Japanese Graphic Character Set which is specified as <strong>ISO IR87</strong>.</p>
<p>There are non-alphabetic encoding systems for which HL7 Table 0211 does not provide specific entries. One of these is the Traditional Chinese character set, CNS 11643, which is used in Taiwan. This character set can, however, be encoded using the Unicode Standard, which does have a value in HL7 0211.</p>
<p>The Unicode Standard (which is now coordinated with ISO 10646) permits the specification of multiple-byte characters in a much larger range than is available in a single-byte ASCII or ISO character set. Unicode Version 3.1 (http://www.unicode.org) includes almost 100,000 characters, including many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ideographs. This is particularly valuable to implementers who need to encode messages in more than one character set, as for example to accommodate the use of both alphabetic and ideographic characters.</p>
<p>Non-alphabetic encoding systems do not restrict characters to a length of one byte. Unicode incorporates three encoding forms that allow for the use of multiple bytes to encode a message. The most flexible Unicode encoding form is UTF-8, which uses high-order bits to specify the number of bytes (from one to six) used to encode each character.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Unicode UTF-8 incorporates the 7-bit ASCII character set as single-byte codes. This means that a message encoded in 7-bit ASCII can be submitted to a destination using Unicode UTF- 8 with no modification.</p>

<p>Definition: Business organization that originated and is accountable for the content of the message.</p>
<p>Currently, MSH provides fields to transmit both sending/receiving applications and facilities (MSH.3 – MSH.6). However, these levels of organization do not necessarily relate to or imply a legal entity such as a business organization. As such, multiple legal entities (organizations) mightshare a service bureau, with the same application and facility identifiers. Another level of detail is required to delineate the various organizations using the same service bureau.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Sending Responsible Organization field provides a complete picture from the application level to the overall business level. The Business Organization represents the legal entity responsible for the contents of the message.</p>
<p>Use Case #1: A centralized system responsible for recording and monitoring instances of communicable diseases enforces a stringent authentication protocol with external applications that have been certified to access its information base. In order to allow message exchange, the centralized system mandates that external applications must provide the identity of the business organization sending the message (<strong>Sending Responsible Organization</strong>), the organization it is sending the message to (<strong>Receiving Responsible Organization</strong>, in this case the "owner" of the communicable diseases system), the network address from which the message has originated (<strong>Sending Network Address</strong>), the network address the message is being transmitted to (<strong>Receiving Network Address</strong>). The organization responsible for protecting the information stored within the communicable disease system requires this authentication due to the sensitive nature of the information it contains.</p>

<p>As with the Sending/Receiving Responsible Organization, the Sending Network Address provides a more detailed picture of the source of the message. This information is lower than the application layer, but is often useful/necessary for routing and identification purposes. This field SHOULD only be populated when the underlying communication protocol does not support identification of sending network locations.</p>
<p>An agreement about the specific values and usage must exist among messaging partners. Use Case:</p>
<p>Dr. Hippocrates works for the ''Good Health Clinic" (Sending facility) with a laptop running application XYZ (Sending App). He needs to talk to the provincial pharmacy system. He dials in and is assigned a network address. He then sends a message to the pharmacy system, which transmits a response back to him. Because the underlying network protocol does not have a place to communicate the sender and receiver network addresses, it therefore requires these addresses to be present in a known position in the payload.</p>
<p>There might be many doctors running application XYZ. In addition, the network address assigned to the laptop might change with each dial-in. This means there is not a 1..1 association between either the facility or the application and the network address.</p>

<h4 id="msh-28-special-access-restriction-instructions-st-2431">MSH-28 Special Access Restriction Instructions (ST) 2431 ? </h4>
<p>Definition: Used to convey specific instructions about the protection of the patient's data, which must be rendered to end users in accordance with patient consent directive, organizational policy, or jurisdictional law. For example, in US law 42 CFR Part 2, disclosed information made with patient consent must include a renderable “Prohibition on re-disclosure” warning (§ 2.32<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>) In addition, organizational policy might require that some or all of the ARV field privacy tag values be rendered to end users, e.g., marking a consult note with “Restricted Confidentiality” or with sensitivity tags such as “VIP” or “EMP” for employee of the organization.</p>
<p>This field MAY also be used to specify instructions about the release of information to family and friends (e.g., "Do not release information to patient's brother, Adam Everyman"). These instructions MAY be in conjunction with other fields (as elected by the system).</p>
<h3 id="nte-notes-and-comments-segment">NTE ‑ notes and comments segment</h3>
<p>The NTE segment is defined here for inclusion in messages defined in other chapters. It is commonly used for sending notes and comments.</p>
<p>The work groups define the meaning of the NTE segments within the context of the messages in their chapters. For each NTE, the description in the message attribute table SHOULD include an indication of the segment associated with the NTE, for example "Notes and Comments for the PID".</p>
<p>NOTE: While sending of segments with no content has been historically used for display messages to indicate blank lines this is not best practice. Senders SHOULD NOT send empty NTEs to indicate blank lines. When blank lines are required senders SHOULD use the functionality of the FT datatype in section <a href="#_Formatting_codes">Formatting codes</a>.</p>

<p>Definition: This field is used when source of comment must be identified. This table MAY be extended locally during implementation. Refer to <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70105"><em>HL7 Table 0105 - Source of Comment</em></a> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="nte-3-comment-ft-00098">NTE-3 Comment (FT) 00098</h4>
<p>Definition: This field contains the comment contained in the segment.</p>
<p>Conditionality Predicate: In support of backwards compatibility, when NTE-9 is populated, the sending system SHALL also populate a human-readable version of the comment in NTE-3. When NTE-9 is not populated then NTE-3 MAY be populated.</p>
<p><strong>Note: NTE-3 has been left blank for the use cases where legacy systems are sending a blank NTE as a line feed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of v2.2, this field uses the FT rather than a TX data type. Since there is no difference between an FT data type without any embedded formatting commands, and a TX data type, this change is compatible with the previous version.</p>

<p>Note: A field already exists on the NTE record that identifies the Sources of Comment (e.g., ancillary, placer, other). However some applications need to support other types of comment text (e.g., instructions, reason, remarks, etc.). A separate NTE segment can be used for each type of comment (e.g., instructions are on one NTE and remarks on another NTE).</p>

Refer to Table 0611 - Coded Comment in Chapter 2C for valid values.</p>
<h3 id="ovr-override-segment">OVR – override segment</h3>
<p>Definition: This segment allows a sender to override specific receiving application's business rules to allow for processing of a message that would normally be rejected or ignored.</p>
<p>In many instances, business rules will be set as guidelines relative to patient care. In some instances it is in the patient's better interest to circumvent these guidelines. In other cases, business rules might exist to support normal process flow, but which couldbe bypassed or ignored under certain special circumstances. This segment is linked to the proposed ERR segment changes in that the first attempt to process a transaction that violates a business rule could result in an error that must be overridden. The ERR provides a mechanism to identify errors that MAY be overridden, as well as the allowed override codes.</p>
<p>Use case #1: A patient has received a prescription with a duration of 30 days and receives the full amount at their pharmacy. While at home the patient accidentally spills the container and spoils a significant proportion of the prescription. The patient returns to their pharmacy and explains the situation to the pharmacy technician. The technician consults with their supervising pharmacist. Knowing the patient, the pharmacist decides to override the business rule stating that the dispensed amount for a prescription can not exceed the prescribed amount. In recording the decision, the pharmacy technician specifies that the <strong>Override Type</strong> is a "Compassionate Refill" and that the <strong>Override Code</strong>, or reason for the override, is "Spoilage". The technician also provides <strong>Override Comments</strong> to provide an explanation of the situation for future reference. While recording the decision, the technician's user ID is automatically stored in an <strong>Override Recorded By</strong> field. The pharmacist's ID is stored in the <strong>Override Responsible Provider</strong> field.</p>
<p>Use case #2:A hospital wishes to submit an invoice to an insurer who is providing secondary coverage. The invoice is being submitted over a week after the service was performed, which is outside the insurer's normal accept time window. The insurer would normally reject the invoice. However, the submitter includes an <strong>Override Type</strong> of "late submission" as well as an <strong>Override Code</strong> indicating that the invoice is late due to delays with the primary payor. The secondary insurer examines the override reason and accepts the invoice.</p>
<p>Usage Note: The override segment SHOULD be included in messages adjacent to the segment(s) containing the information that would trigger the business rule(s) that needs to be overridden. The segment SHOULD be optional (you shouldn't always need to override business rules), and SHOULD be allowed to repeat in circumstances where there can be more than one business rule overridden at the same time. Committees MAY wish to provide suggested values for override types or codes for use with the OVR segment in different messages.</p>
<p>The following is an example of how the OVR segment might be used in a dispense message (RDS_O13):</p>
<p>MSH PID PV1 {ORC RXE {RXR} RXD {RXR} &lt;RXC&gt; &lt;NTE&gt; &lt;FT1&gt; &lt;OVR&gt;}</p>

<p>Definition: Identifies the user entering the override in the system.</p>
<p>When a business rule is overridden, an application must be able to link the override with the user who made it in order to provide a complete audit history of the transaction, especially when there might be a risk associated with the override. In situations where the original message was submitted by batch, the overriding user MAY be different than the original author of the message.</p>

<p>Definition: Identifies the health services provider who accepts professional responsibility for overriding the business rule. This field SHOULD be left empty if the recording and responsible health care provider is the same as who entered the override.</p>
<p>In some cases, a business rule override might be entered by a data entry clerk on behalf of a health service provider who carries professional responsibility for the decision to override the rule. In order to represent this scenario, the segment must have a field identifying who is responsible for the override decision, in addition to the person recording the override.</p>
<h3 id="sft-software-segment">SFT – software segment</h3>
<p>Definition: This segment provides additional information about the software product(s) used as a Sending Application. The primary purpose of this segment is for diagnostic use. There MAY be additional uses per site-specific agreements.</p>
<p>Implementers are encouraged to use message profile identifiers (as found in <em>2.14.9.21</em>, "<em>MSH-21 Message Profile Identifier (EI) 01598</em>") to control the behavior of the receiving application rather than relying on application or version information in the SFT segment.</p>
<p>For example, if software product A has versions 9 and 10 deployed in different Enterprise locations, the fact that they use different message types, segments, or fields SHOULD be reflected via their message profiles (see section 2B, "Conformance Using Message Profiles"). If there is an upgrade from version 10 to 10.1, this would be reflected in the SFT segment, but changes to the message contents SHOULD be reflected via a new/different conformance profile.</p>
<p>Use Case: An external application has been customized to communicate with a centralized patient drug history system. However, due to certain, known characteristics of the external software package, the centralized system must modify its behavior in order to process transactions correctly. In one example, the external application could have multiple versions in production. As such, the centralized application will need to know the name of the <strong>Software Vendor Organization</strong>, the <strong>Software Release Number</strong>, the <strong>Software Product Name</strong>, and the <strong>Software Binary ID</strong> so that it can correctly identify the software submitting the transaction and modify its behavior appropriately.</p>
<p>While preparing a transaction for submission to a centralized system the sending application specifies its <strong>Software Install Date</strong> and its configuration settings (<strong>Software Product Information</strong>). While processing the transaction, the centralized system encounters an error. Upon examination of the error, install date and configuration of the software that sent the message, helpdesk staff are able to determine the sending application has not been updated to reflect recent application changes.</p>
<p>Use Case: In circumstances where a message is manipulated or modified by multiple systems, a repetition of this segment MAY be appended by each system.</p>

<p>Definition: Organization identification information for the software vendor that created this transaction. The purpose of this field, along with the remaining fields in this segment, is to provide a more complete picture of applications that are sending HL7 messages. The Software Vendor Organization field would allow the identification of the vendor who is responsible for maintaining the application.</p>
<h4 id="sft-2-software-certified-version-or-release-number-st-01835">SFT-2 Software Certified Version or Release Number (ST) 01835</h4>
<p>Definition: Latest software version number of the sending system that has been compliance tested and accepted. Software Certified Version or Release Number helps to provide a complete picture of the application that is sending/receiving HL7 messages. Versions are important in identifying a specific 'release' of an application. In some situations, the receiving application validates the Software Certified Version or Release Number against a list of "certified" versions/releases of the particular software to determine if the sending application adheres to specific business rules required by the receiving application.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the software MAY perform different processing depending on the version of the sending software</p>
<h4 id="sft-3-software-product-name-st-01836">SFT-3 Software Product Name (ST) 01836</h4>
<p>Definition: The name of the software product that submitted the transaction. A key component in the identification of an application is its Software Product Name. This is a key piece of information in identifying an application.</p>
<h4 id="sft-4-software-binary-id-st-01837">SFT-4 Software Binary ID (ST) 01837</h4>
<p>Definition: Issued by a vendor for each unique software version instance to distinguish between like versions of the same software e.g., a checksum.</p>
<p>Software Binary Ids are issued for each unique software version instance. As such, this information helps to differentiate between differing versions of the same software. Identical Primary IDs indicate that the software is identical at the binary level (configuration settings mmightdiffer).</p>
<h4 id="sft-5-software-product-information-tx-01838">SFT-5 Software Product Information (TX) 01838</h4>
<p>Definition: Software identification information that can be supplied by a software vendor with their transaction. Might include configuration settings, etc.</p>
<p>This field would contain any additional information an application provides with the transaction it has submitted. This information could be used for diagnostic purposes and provides greater flexibility in identifying a piece of software. Possibilities include setup or configuration parameter information.</p>
<p>This field SHOULD NOT be sent unless performing diagnostics.</p>
<h4 id="sft-6-software-install-date-dtm-01839">SFT-6 Software Install Date (DTM) 01839</h4>
<p>Definition: Date the submitting software was installed at the sending site.</p>
<p>A Software Install Date on its own can often provide key information about the behavior of the application, and is necessary to provide a complete picture of the sending application.</p>
<h3 id="sgh-segment-group-header-segment">SGH – segment group header segment</h3>

<h3 id="uac---user-authentication-credential-segment">UAC - user authentication credential segment</h3>
<p>Definition: This optional segment provides user authentication credentials, a Kerberos Service Ticket or SAML assertion, to be used by the receiving system to obtain user identification data. Refer to <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70615"><em>HL7 Table 0615 - User Authentication Credential Type Code</em></a> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables. It is to be used in when the receiving application system requires the sending system to provide end-user identification for accountability or access control in interactive applications. Since user authentication implementations often limit the time period for validity of the session authentication credentials, this segment is not intended for use in non-interactive applications.</p>
<p>It is possible that various user authentication credential standards' data mightbe communicated. Kerberos and SAML are two such standards. A user authentication credential is an encapsulated data (ED type) element, as defined by standards, with no HL7-relevant structure.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The UAC segment is defined for use within simple protocols, such as MLLP, that do not have user authentication semantics. Implementations that use WSDL/SOAP, or similar protocols, to envelope HL7 SHOULD employ the user authentication semantics and data structures available within the scope of those protocols rather than the UAC segment.</p>
<p>If the receiving system accepts the user credentials in the UAC segment, no specific acknowledgment is required. However, if the receiving system detects an error while processing the UAC segment, its acknowledgment message SHALL report it to the sender via an MSA and ERR segment pair:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The ERR-3 (error code) field value is 207 to signify an application error</p></li>
<li><p>The ERR-7 (diagnostic information) field reports the specific error. Examples of possible errors are:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>User credentials expected but not provided</p></li>
<li><p>User credentials invalid</p></li>
<li><p>User credentials expired</p></li>
<li><p>User credentials from an unknown or untrusted source</p></li>
<li><p>User unknown</p></li>
<li><p>User not allowed to create or access data on the receiving system.</p></li>
<li><p>User not allowed to initiate a processing function on the receiving system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When an MSA and ERR segment pair is reported to the sender, an application data response SHALL NOT occur. In such cases it is correct to assume that the sending application's user is not authorized to get the data.</p>
<p>The processing rules for the ERR segment are outside of HL7's scope.</p>

<h3 id="message-fragmentation">Message fragmentation</h3>
<p>This summarizes the methodology for splitting a single logical HL7 message among two or more actual HL7 messages. The actual specifications for this, the segment definitions of the ADD and DSC segments, and examples are in Section <em>2.10.2</em>, "<em>Continuation messages and segments</em>".</p>
<p>Continuing of messages is a generic methodology that can be used for all HL7 message types. It can be used to split based on segment boundaries, on field boundaries, and to split a single field among several messages. It utilizes two specific segments, ADD and DSC, as well as a field in the message header, MSH-14 Continuation Pointer.</p>
<p>When a message is continued, a unique continuation value is used. This same value will appear in MSH-14 and DSC-1 as appropriate for a single pair of messages. This allows messages to be "chained together".</p>
<p>Here are two examples of ways to create continuation pointers for fragmented messages. The only absolute requirement is that when the sending application values the continuation pointer, the receiving application can appropriately reconstruct the message.</p>
<p>Sitecode-interfaceapplicationcode-date-sequentialcounterwithindate</p>
<p>This will guarantee uniqueness of this field.</p>
<p>e.g., BWH-LDS-19990331-27 for the 27<sup>th</sup> large message to be created on March 31, within the Discharge Summary interfaces at BWH</p>
<p>An alternative method of valuing the continuation pointer:</p>
<p>Sitecode-interfaceapplicationcode-medicalrecordnumber-datetime</p>
<p>e.g.. MGH-PCIS-1234567-19980331121314 for a message created on March 31, at 12:13:14pm for patient medical record number 1234567, within the PCIS interfaces at MGH</p>
<p>Sending Application Note: In the ADD segment, a trailing field delimiter, i.e., the vertical bar character, after the final field, has explicit meaning. The sending application SHOULD NOT include a trailing field delimiter for the last field in the ADD segment unless it has completely valued the entire field from the message being continued.</p>
<p>Receiving Application Note: The receiving application will need to be concerned with a single segment and a single field being continued.</p>
<p>Receiving a message with an empty ADD segment followed by a DSC segment is the notification that the segment preceding the ADD is being continued in a subsequent message. Note that the continuing message might not be the next one received! The receiver must match up the continuation pointer value from MSH-14 of subsequent messages to the DSC-1 continuation pointer value of the prior message. Also if the continuing message contains an ADD segment, the receiver SHOULD continue appending to the fields from the segment being continued with values from the ADD segment. For example, if OBX-5 is being continued, the continuation will appear in ADD-1 of the continuing message. If there were a value for OBX-13 of the original message, that would appear in ADD-9 of the continuing message, assuming that the remainder of the OBX segment fit into the single ADD segment.</p>
<p>Question: if continuing a message after the completion of a complete segment, SHOULD the continuing message have an empty ADD segment or not? Answer: No. This means that a continuing message need not have an ADD segment, if the continued message was split on a segment boundary.</p>
<p>Notation conventions: items within angle brackets are comments and not intended to represent a portion of an actual message. For example, &lt;this is a comment&gt;.</p>
<p>Note the multiple continuation pointer values, one for each pair of physical messages.</p>

<p>The following examples discuss an unsolicited transmission of an observation message, ORU^R01.</p>
<p>The expected result values in OBX-5 Observation Value, for reports (e.g., autopsy, pathology) MAY exceed the message length restrictions of one or more interfaces.</p>
<p>Thus the OBX-5 Observation Value data element will be split into more than one message.</p>
