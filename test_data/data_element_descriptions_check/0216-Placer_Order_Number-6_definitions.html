<h2>Data Element #216 - Placer Order Number</h2><h3>6 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4 ORC.2 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is the placer application's order number.</p>
<p>This field is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (See Section 2.A.28, "EI &#x2013; Entity Identifier"). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, "HD &#x2013; Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.</p>
<p>There are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique):</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>in ORC-1-order control value of RO, following an RU replacement;</p></li>
<li><p>in ORC-1-order control value of CH (child orders); and</p></li>
<li><p>in ORC-1-order control value of SN (send number).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>See the Table Notes under ORC-1-order control for the details of how the ORC-2-placer order number is assigned in these cases.</p>
<p>The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).</p>
<p>The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.</p>
<p>From that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.</p>
<p>If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both ORC-2 and OBR-2 are valued then they must be valued the same; as well, if both ORC-3 and OBR-3 are valued, then they must be valued the same. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated.</p>
<p>These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 4 OBR.2 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is identical to ORC-2-Placer Order Number.</p>
<p>This field is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (Chapter 2A, section 2.A.28). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, "HD &#x2013; Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.</p>

<p>Definition: This field is the placer application's order number.</p>
<p>This is a composite field. The first component is a string of characters that identifies an individual order (i.e., OBR). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the (filler) assigning authority of the placing application. The (filler) assigning authority is a string of characters that will be uniquely associated with an application. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique entity identifiers. The components are separated by component delimiters.</p>
<p>TXA-14 - Condition: If corresponding ORC and/or OBR segments are present in the message and ORC-2 or OBR-2 is valued, this field must be blank. If TXA-14 is valued while ORC-2 or OBR-2 is valued it shall be ignored. See message definitions including TXA for further guidance on which ORC/OBR pairs to consider.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 5th Description: Ch. 10 ARQ.24 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is the placer application's order number for the order associated with this scheduling request.</p>
<p>This field is described in detail in Chapter 4, section 4.5.1.2, "ORC-2 &#x2013; Placer Order Number." It is an optional field, but if a Placer order number is present, then a Filler order number (<em>ARQ-25 &#x2013; Filler Order Number</em>) must also be present.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 6th Description: Ch. 10 SCH.26 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is the placer application's order number for the order associated with this scheduling filler application response.</p>
<p>This field is described in detail in Section 4.5.1.2. It is an optional field, but if a Placer order number is present, then a Filler order number (Section 10.6.2.27) must also be present. Both this field and the Filler order number below may have been sent as part of the appointment request in the ARQ segment or they may be assigned by the scheduling filler application only.</p>
