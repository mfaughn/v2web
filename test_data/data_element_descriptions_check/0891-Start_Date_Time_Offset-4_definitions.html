<h2>Data Element #891 - Start Date/Time Offset</h2><h3>4 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 10 AIS.5 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the offset this service needs for the appointment, expressed in units of time relative to the scheduled start date/time. This field allows the application to identify that the service is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment's start date/time. The first component contains the offset amount. An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field indicates that the service is required at the start date/time of the appointment.</p>
<p>A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the service is required after the appointment's start date/time. Specifying a negative offset indicates that the service is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment. Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment's start date/time.</p>
<p>This field is conditionally required. If a value for <em>AIS-5-Start Date/Time Offset</em> is not provided, then a value is required for this field. To specify that there is no difference between the appointment's start date/time and the resource's start date/time either replicate the appointment's start date/time into this field, or specify an offset of zero (0) in <em>AIS-5-Start Date/Time Offset</em> and any valid time unit code in <em>AIS-6-Start Date/Time Offset Units</em>.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 10 AIG.9 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the offset that this resource needs for the appointment, expressed in units of time relative to the scheduled start date/time. This field indicates to the application that the resource is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment's start date/time. The first component indicates the offset amount. An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field, indicates that the resource is required at the start date/time of the appointment.</p>
<p>A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the resource is required after the appointment's start date/time. Specifying a negative offset indicates that the resource is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment. Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment's start date/time.</p>
<p>This field is conditionally required. If a value for <em>AIG-8-Start Date/Time</em> is not provided, then a value is required for this field. To specify that there is no difference between the appointment's start date/time and the resource's start date/time either replicate the appointment's start date/time into this field, or specify an offset of zero (0) in <em>AIG-9-Start Date/Time Offset</em> and any valid time unit code in <em>AIG10-Start Date/Time Offset Units</em>.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 3rd Description: Ch. 10 AIL.7 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the offset this resource needs for the appointment, expressed in units of time relative to the scheduled start date/time. This field indicates to the application that the resource is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment's start date/time. The first component contains the offset amount. An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field, indicates that the resource is required at the start date/time of the appointment.</p>
<p>A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the resource is required after the appointment's start date/time. Specifying a negative offset indicates that the resource is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment. Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment's start date/time.</p>
<p>This field is conditionally required. If a value for <em>AIL-6 Start Date/Time</em> is not provided, then a value is required for this field. To specify that there is no difference between the appointment's start date/time and the resource's start date/time either replicate the appointment's start date/time into this field, or specify an offset of zero (0) in <em>AIL-7 Start Date/Time Offset</em> and any valid time unit code in <em>AIL-8 Start Date/Time Offset Units</em>.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 4th Description: Ch. 10 AIP.7 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the offset this resource needs for the appointment, expressed in units of time relative to the scheduled start date/time. This field indicates to the application that the resource is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment's start date/time. The first component contains the offset amount. An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field, indicates that the resource is required at the start date/time of the appointment.</p>
<p>A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the resource is required after the appointment's start date/time. Specifying a negative offset indicates that the resource is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment. Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment's start date/time.</p>
<p>This field is conditionally required. If a value for <em>AIP-6 Start Date/Time</em> is not provided, then a value is required for this field. To specify that there is no difference between the appointment's start date/time and the resource's start date/time either replicate the appointment's start date/time into this field, or specify an offset of zero (0) in <em>AIP-7 Start Date/Time Offset</em> and any valid time unit code in <em>AIP-8 Start Date/Time Offset Units.</em></p>
