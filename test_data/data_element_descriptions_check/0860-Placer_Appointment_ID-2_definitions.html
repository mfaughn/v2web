<h2>Data Element #860 - Placer Appointment ID</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 10 ARQ.1 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field contains placer application's permanent identifier for the appointment request (and the scheduled appointment itself, when confirmed as booked by the filler application). This is a composite field. The first component is a string that identifies an individual appointment request, or booked appointment. It is assigned by the placer application, and it identifies an appointment request, and the subsequent scheduled appointment, uniquely among all such requests and/or booked appointments from a particular requesting application. If the placer appointment ID identifies a parent of a repeating schedule request, then the individual scheduled child appointments can be uniquely identified either by a new placer appointment ID or the parent's placer appointment ID plus an occurrence number, specified in <em>ARQ-3-Occurrence number.</em></p>
<p>The second through fourth components contain the assigning authority identifying information.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 10 SCH.1 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field contains the placer application's permanent identifier for the appointment request (and the scheduled appointment itself, when it has been confirmed as a booked slot by the filler application). This is a composite field.</p>
<p>The first component is a string that identifies an individual appointment request, or a booked appointment. It is assigned by the placer application, and identifies an appointment request, and the subsequent scheduled appointment, uniquely among all such requests and/or booked appointments from a particular requesting application. If <em>SCH-1-Placer Appointment ID</em> identifies a parent of a repeating schedule request, then the individual child scheduled appointments can be uniquely identified either by a new <em>SCH-1-Placer Appointment ID</em> or by <em>SCH-23-Parent Placer Appointment ID</em> plus an <em>SCH-3-Occurrence Number</em>.</p>
<p>If a schedule request originates from a placer it MUST have a placer appointment ID. If the filler sends responses, it may use the placer appointment ID and/or assign a filler appointment ID (which it would echo back to the placer to enable the placer application to associate the two). If the placer appointment ID is not present, the filler appointment ID must be present and vice versa.</p>
