<h2>Data Element #248 - Specimen Received Date/Time *</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4 OBR.14 ----------</h4><p><strong>Attention: <em>The OBR-14 element was retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7. See SPM in Chapter 7.</em></strong></p><br><h4 style='background-color:yellow'>Description from Ch.7: OBR.14 is the same as that from Ch.4: OBR.14</h4><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 7 SPM.18 ----------</h4><p>Definition: The specimen received date/time is the time that the specimen is received at the diagnostic service facility. The actual time that is recorded is based on how specimen receipt is managed and may correspond to the time the sample is logged in. This is fundamentally different from <em>SPM-17 Specimen Collection date/time</em>.</p>
