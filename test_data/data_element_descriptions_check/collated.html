<p>Definition: A code representing the taxonomic classification (e.g. species and/or breed) of an organism. This may include the common or scientific name in the description component, based on the coding system(s) used. SNOMED-CT is the recommended coding system. If this field is not valued, a human is assumed. If the specificity of the coding system is insufficient to represent the organism to the degree desired, the most detailed coded value available may be used in this field and additional information sent in the text field, <em>PID-37 &#x2013; Strain</em>.</p>

<h2>Data Element #216 - Placer Order Number</h2><h3>6 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<hr>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4 ORC.2 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is the placer application's order number.</p>
<p>This field is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (See Section 2.A.28, "EI &#x2013; Entity Identifier"). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, "HD &#x2013; Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.</p>
<p>There are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique):</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>in ORC-1-order control value of RO, following an RU replacement;</p></li>
<li><p>in ORC-1-order control value of CH (child orders); and</p></li>
<li><p>in ORC-1-order control value of SN (send number).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>See the Table Notes under ORC-1-order control for the details of how the ORC-2-placer order number is assigned in these cases.</p>
<p>The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).</p>
<p>The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.</p>
<p>From that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.</p>
<p>If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both ORC-2 and OBR-2 are valued then they must be valued the same; as well, if both ORC-3 and OBR-3 are valued, then they must be valued the same. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated.</p>
<p>These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 4 OBR.2 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is identical to ORC-2-Placer Order Number.</p>
<p>This field is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (Chapter 2A, section 2.A.28). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, "HD &#x2013; Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.</p>

<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4 ORC.3 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is the order number associated with the filling application. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (Section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filler (receiving) application. This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time.</p>
<p>The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see Section 2.A.36, "HD &#x2013; hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.</p>
<p>A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third- party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the filler application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).</p>
<p>The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.</p>
<p>From that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.</p>
<p>If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both ORC-2 and OBR-2 are valued, then they must be valued the same; as well, if both ORC-3 and OBR-3 are valued, then they must be valued the same. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated.</p>
<p>The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to "CA" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 4 OBR.3 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: This field is the order number associated with the filling application. This is a permanent identifier for an order and its associated observations. It is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (see Chapter 2, section 2.A.28, "EI &#x2013; entity identifier").</p>
<p>The first component is a string that identifies an individual order segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filling (receiving) application. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time.</p>

<p>Definition: This field is the order number associated with the filling application. Where a transcription service or similar organization creates the document and uses an internally unique identifier, that number should be inserted in this field.

This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (i.e., transcription service). This uniqueness must persist over time. Where a number is reused over time, a date can be affixed to the non-unique number to make it unique.</p>
<p>The second through fourth components contains the (filler) assigning authority. The (filler) assigning authority is a string of characters that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. The second through fourth components of the filler order number always identify the actual filler of an order.</p>

<p>Definition: This field is defined to make it available for other types of linkages (e.g., toxicology). This important information, together with the information in OBR-29-Parent Result Obersvation Identifier and OBR-54 Parent Order<em>,</em> uniquely identifies the parent result's OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports, or the specific result for which this order or observation is a reflex. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. In the case of a reflex order, if it is necessary to point to the specific result value for which it is in response, OBR-26 enables pointing to that specific OBX segment.</p>
<p>The third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture.</p>
<p>We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.</p>

<p>Definition: This field is defined to make it available for other types of linkages (e.g., toxicology). This important information, together with the information in <em>OBR-29-Parent Result Obersvation Identifier</em> and <em>OBR-54 Parent Order,</em> uniquely identifies the parent result's OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports, or the specific result for which this order or observation is a reflex. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. In the case of a reflex order, if it is necessary to point to the specific result value for which it is in response, OBR-26 enables pointing to that specific OBX segment.</p>
<p>The third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture.</p>
<p>We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.</p>
<p>This field is present only when the parent result is identified by <em>OBR-29-</em> Result Observation Identifier or OBR-54, Parent Order<em>,</em> and the parent spawns child orders or results for each of many results. (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.)</p>
<p>A second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX). If more than one organism is present, <em>OBX-4-observation sub-ID</em> is used to distinguish them. In this case, the first OBX with subID N will contain a value identifying the Nth microorganism, and each additional OBX with subID N will contain susceptibility values for a given antimicrobial test on this organism.</p>

<h2>Data Element #1330 - Accession Identifier</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<hr>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4 IPC.1 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)&gt;</p>
<p>Definition: A workflow-management IDIS generated number that identifies the Filler Order for an Imaging Service (Imaging Service Request). This identifier corresponds one-to-one to the Order Filler number but is used in internal tracking of the work by the IDIS and in communication between IDIS within the department. It also has specific requirements to assure its compatibility with DICOM. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies the Imaging Service Request. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0008,0050) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field.</p>
<p>An IDIS that performs functions of the workflow management for a department may accept a single Placer Order that gives rise to one or more Filler Orders-Imaging Service Requests. For example, an IDIS may receive an order for an X-ray examination of the patient daily at 8 am for the next three days. For the purposes of fulfilling the Placer Order, it will identify each of the daily exams either as a separate Filler Order or parts of a single Filler Order. Correspondingly, it will assign one or more Filler Order numbers associated with the order. For each of the Filler Order numbers, it will assign a unique Accession Number.</p>
<p>Each of the Imaging Service Requests may contain one or more Requested Procedures that it will identify with the Requested Procedure ID. The Requested Procedure is the most granular unit of work that may lead to the creation of the procedure report. Each procedure report contributes to the results for the order. In the example mentioned above, each of the daily examinations will require a separate diagnostic report, hence each of them will be treated as a separate Requested Procedure. Depending on the treatment of the order by the IDIS, it will either link all Requested Procedures to a single Filler Order-Imaging Service Request, or link each Requested Procedure to its own Imaging Service Request. Exact type of requested procedure is conveyed by the coded values in OBR-44 Procedure Code and OBR-45 Procedure Code modifier for each procedure. Note that in case of multiple Requested Procedures corresponding to one order, each procedure may have different code.</p>
<p>To support communication with the instances of equipment in a department (acquisition modalities), IDIS will also generate the Study Instance UID, a globally unique identifier for each Requested Procedure. This identifier will be used by acquisition modalities to identify all generated images and other DICOM objects related to this Requested Procedure. Note that, unlike the Study Instance UID, the Requested Procedure ID must only be unique within the scope of the encompassing Imaging Service Request identified by an Accession Number.</p>
<p>Each of the Requested Procedures may be further broken down by the IDIS into the Scheduled Procedure Steps based on the timing and equipment requirements. Each step is identified with the Scheduled Procedure Step ID. A single Procedure Step may only be performed on a single type and instance of the equipment. Thus, while the Requested Procedure may identify multi-modality examination (such as ones common in Nuclear Medicine), a single Procedure Step shall correspond to the operations performed on a single modality.</p>
<p>The example of the hierarchy of Imaging Service Request, Requested Procedure and Scheduled Procedure Step is depicted in a figure 4-6. Identifiers of the entities are represented by the field names stated in square brackets.</p>
<p>Figure 4-6. Hierarchy of Imaging Service Request, Requested Procedure and Scheduled Procedure Step</p>
<p>The full hierarchy constitutes the context that will be shared between all IDIS within a department in a course of order fulfillment.</p>
<p>Each OMI message shall convey information about Requested Procedure(s) pertaining to one order. A pair of Segments ORC/OBR shall correspond to each requested procedure. If the Requested Procedure is comprised of multiple Procedure Steps, multiple IPC segments shall be included for each ORC/OBR pair in the message. Value of the IPC-1 field shall be identical in all IPC segments.</p>
<p>Considering the preceding example of X-ray examinations on subsequent days with two different steps identified for the last Requested Procedure and examinations to be performed at the site, "RADIOLOGY", the communication of the information using OMI message may look like the following:</p>

<p>Definition: This field identifies the medical substance or treatment that has been ordered to be given to the patient, as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment supplier; it is equivalent to <em>OBR-4-universal service ID</em> in function. In the RXE segment, this give code must be fully encoded. The dispense fields, which define the units and amount of what is to be issued to the patient (see <em>RXE-10-dispense amount</em> and <em>RXE-11-dispense units</em> below) do not necessarily correlate with the instructions of what amount is to be "given" or administered with each dose, and may or may not be specified with the order. For example, the "give" part of the order may convey the field-representation of <em>give 250 mg of Ampicillin</em>, while the request to dispense part of the order may convey <em>issue 30 tablets of generic equivalent for this outpatient prescription</em>.</p>
<p>The coding system used is conditional on both the nature of the medical substance or treatment ordered and site-specific implementation considerations. For vaccines, <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70292"><em>HL7 Table 0292 &#x2013; Vaccines Administered</em></a> is the preferred coding system. For non-vaccine products, the coding system may be a local implementation of <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70479"><em>User-defined Table 0479 &#x2013; Pharmaceutical Substances</em></a> or an external coding system. Examples of external coding systems include, but are not limited to, National Drug Codes (NDC), Medispan Generic Product Identifier (MGPI), Drug Descriptor Identifier (DDID), and other drug codes listed in <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396"><em>HL7 Table 0396 &#x2013; Coding Systems</em></a>.

<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 7 OBX.2 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field defines the data type of OBX-5, Observation Value. If OBX-5, Observation Value, is valued then OBX-2, Value Type, SHALL be valued. When OBX-5, Observation Value, is not valued, OBX-2 Value Type MAY be valued to represent a data type used to value the observation expressed in OBX-3, Observation Identifier.

<blockquote>
<p>Condition: This field is required if OBX-5, Observation Value, is valued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if the value is 'CWE' then the result in OBX-5 must be a coded entry or text or both. As of v 2.7, the ST data type may not be used to transmit data that can be more precisely transmitted using other data types, e.g. SN when comparative symbols are needed.</p>
<p>The RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the OBX-5 contains a pointer to the data e.g., a URL of an image. The receiving system can use this reference pointer whenever it needs access to the actual data through other interface standards, e.g., DICOM, or through appropriate data base servers.</p>
<p>The structured numeric (SN) data type provides for reporting ranges (e.g., 3-5 or 10-20), titres (e.g., 1:10), and out-of-range indicators (e.g., &gt;50) in a structured and computer-interpretable way.</p>
<p>We allow the FT data type in the OBX segment, but its use is discouraged. Formatted text usually implies a meaningful structure, e.g., a list of three independent diagnoses reported on different lines. But ideally, the structure in three independent diagnostic statements would be reported as three separate OBX segments.</p>
<p>TX should <strong>not</strong> be used except to send large amounts of text. In the TX data type, the repeat delimiter can only be used to identify paragraph breaks. Use ST to send short, and possibly encodable, text strings.</p>
<p>CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment in any message that can exchange documents (such as MDM or ORU). Within the OBX segment, the MIME package is encoded as an encapsulated (ED) data type.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 8 OM3.7 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the allowed data type for a single categorical observation (code A or C in <em>OM1-18 - Nature of Observation</em>).

<p>Definition: This field is the units that have a data type of CWE. The default coding system for the units codes consists of the ISO+ abbreviation for a single case unit (ISO 2955&#x2011;83) plus extensions, that do not collide with ISO abbreviations (see Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6). We designate this coding system as ISO+. Both the ISO unit's abbreviations and the extensions are defined in Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6.2 and listed in Figure 7-9. The ISO+ abbreviations are the codes for the default coding system. Consequently, when ISO+ units are being used, only ISO+ abbreviations need be sent, and the contents of the units field will be backward compatible to HL7 Version 2.1. For more information on this field see reference Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6.</p>

<p>Definition: This field identifies the phase of the study that a patient has entered. The set of codes will generally be developed for each clinical trial, although there are patterns that trials in particular disease or prevention categories may follow. The phase structure will be based on data collation and reporting needs for the study. It is an operational structure and need not be discussed in the clinical trial protocol documentation or even made known to patient care or data collection personnel. The coding system will usually be developed by the sponsor for multicentered clinical trials to standardize the receipt of automated data. Local codes could be added if an additional local message is desired. Otherwise, local coding conventions will be used. Refer to Table 0587 - Study Phase Identifier in Chapter 2C for valid values.</p>

<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 8 OM1.22 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the date and time of the last change in the test procedure that would make previous results incompatible with new results, e.g., the last time that normal reference range or units changed for a numeric test/observation.</p>
<p>We strongly suggest that observation producers never use the same observation ID when the measurement procedures change in such a way that results produced under the new procedure are clinically different from those produced with the old procedure. Rather, the producer should try to adjust the new procedure so that its values are clinically indistinguishable from the old. Failing that, one should create a new observation ID for the observation produced under the new procedure.</p>
<p>In the rare circumstances when a procedure change occurs and neither of the above two options is viable, this field shall be used to transmit the effective date/time of the new procedure. The receiving system shall assume that any values that come across under this observation ID are under the new procedure after this date and take appropriate steps to distinguish the old from the new observations.</p>
<p>This number is included to provide a means of communicating with the observation producing service when they have questions about particular observations or results.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 8 OM7.19 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the date and time of the last change in the test procedure that would make previous results incompatible with new results.</p>

<p>Definition: This field contains the placer application's permanent identifier for the appointment request (and the scheduled appointment itself, when it has been confirmed as a booked slot by the filler application). This is a composite field.</p>
<p>The first component is a string that identifies an individual appointment request, or a booked appointment. It is assigned by the placer application, and identifies an appointment request, and the subsequent scheduled appointment, uniquely among all such requests and/or booked appointments from a particular requesting application. If <em>SCH-1-Placer Appointment ID</em> identifies a parent of a repeating schedule request, then the individual child scheduled appointments can be uniquely identified either by a new <em>SCH-1-Placer Appointment ID</em> or by <em>SCH-23-Parent Placer Appointment ID</em> plus an <em>SCH-3-Occurrence Number</em>.</p>
<p>If a schedule request originates from a placer it MUST have a placer appointment ID. If the filler sends responses, it may use the placer appointment ID and/or assign a filler appointment ID (which it would echo back to the placer to enable the placer application to associate the two).

This field is provided for situations in which filler applications maintain multiple schedules, and in which a particular resource or set of resources is controlled by more than one of those schedules.</p>
<p>If a new appointment must be booked, it may be necessary to provide a schedule ID to uniquely identify the intended slot(s) being requested in the transaction. After the request has been assigned to one or more slots; however, the filler application should assign a unique filler appointment ID (see sections <em>10.6.1.1</em>, "<em>ARQ-1 Placer Appointment ID (EI) 00860</em>," and <em>10.6.1.2</em>, "<em>ARQ-2 Filler Appointment ID (EI) 00861</em>)." This filler appointment ID, as its definition indicates, should uniquely identify the appointment among all such requests and appointments within the filler application. This means that, once assigned, the filler appointment ID should uniquely identify the appointment (either as a request or as a booked appointment) without a need to provide the schedule ID too. As a cautionary note regarding implementation, if the filler appointment ID would not otherwise be unique, it may be necessary to include the schedule ID as part of the filler appointment ID. This can be done either by prefixing the appointment ID with the schedule ID, or by appending the schedule ID to the appointment ID.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 10 SCH.5 ----------</h4><p>Components: &lt;Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Text (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Name of Coding System (ID)&gt; ^ &lt;Alternate Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Alternate Text (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)&gt; ^ &lt;Coding System Version ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Original Text (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Second Alternate Identifier (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Second Alternate Text (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)&gt; ^ &lt;Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Coding System OID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Value Set OID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Value Set Version ID (DTM)&gt; ^ &lt;Alternate Coding System OID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Alternate Value Set OID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)&gt; ^ &lt;Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)&gt; ^ &lt;Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)&gt;</p>
