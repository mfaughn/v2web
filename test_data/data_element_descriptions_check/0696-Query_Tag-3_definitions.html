<h2>Data Element #696 - Query Tag</h2><h3>3 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 5 QAK.1 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field may be valued by the initiating system to identify the query, and may be used to match response messages to the originating query. If it is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgment segment (QAK). This field differs from <em>MSA-2-message control ID</em> in that its value remains constant for each message (i.e., all continuation messages) associated with the query, whereas <em>MSA-2-Message control ID</em> may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole. <em>QAK-1-Query tag</em> is not conditional on the presence of the <em>QRD-1-Query ID</em> field in the original mode queries; in the original mode queries <em>QAK-1-Query tag</em> is not used.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 5 QID.1 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field identifies the instance of a query.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 3rd Description: Ch. 5 QPD.2 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field may be valued by the initiating system to identify the query, and may be used to match response messages to the originating query. If this field is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgement segment (QAK).</p>
<p>This field differs from <em>MSA-2-Message control ID</em> in that its value remains constant for each message (i.e., all continuation messages) associated with the query, whereas <em>MSA-2-Message control ID</em> may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole.</p>
<p><em><strong>Implementation considerations:</strong></em> It is not necessary to value this field in implementations where the only return message on the socket will be the response to the query that was just sent. Conversely, in an "asynchronous" implementation where many queries, responses, and other messages may be communicated bidirectionally over the same socket, it is essential that this field be valued so that the Client knows to which query the Server is responding.</p>
