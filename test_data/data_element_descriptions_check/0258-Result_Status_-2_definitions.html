<h2>Data Element #258 - Result Status +</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4 OBR.25 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the status of results for this order. This conditional field is required whenever the OBR is contained in a report message. It is not required as part of an initial order.</p>
<p>There are two methods of sending status information. If the status is that of the entire order, use ORC-15-order effective date/time and ORC-5-order status. If the status pertains to the order detail segment, use OBR-25-result status and OBR-22-results rpt/status chng &#x2013; date/time. If both are present, the OBR values override the ORC values.</p>
<p>This field would typically be used in a response to an order status query where the level of detail requested does not include the OBX segments. When the individual status of each result is necessary, OBX-11-observ result status may be used. Refer to <a href="V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70123">HL7 Table 0123 &#x2013; Result Status</a> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.</p><br><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 7 OBR.25 ----------</h4><p>Definition: This field contains the status of results for this order.
