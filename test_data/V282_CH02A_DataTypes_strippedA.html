<h4 id="section-3"></h4>
<h4 id="channel-calibration-sensitivity-correction-factor-nm">Channel Calibration Sensitivity Correction Factor (NM)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component defines a correction factor for channel sensitivity, which may be derived from the last calibration procedure performed. The actual channel sensitivity is the nominal channel sensitivity given in the previous component multiplied by the unitless correction factor.</p>
<h4 id="channel-calibration-baseline-nm">Channel Calibration Baseline (NM)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component defines the actual channel baseline (the data value which corresponds to a nominal input signal of zero). The actual baseline may differ from the ideal because of a dc offset in the amplifier connected to the ADC. The actual baseline values for all channels (which need not be integers) may be determined at the time of calibration as the average digitized values obtained when a zero input signal is connected to each channel.</p>
<h4 id="channel-calibration-time-skew-nm">Channel Calibration Time Skew (NM) </h4>
<p>Definition: This component defines the time difference between the nominal sampling (digitization) time (which would be the same for all channels) and the actual sampling time of the channel, in seconds (or fractions thereof). This value will differ from zero when all channels in the montage are not sampled simultaneously, as occurs in systems, which sample successive channels at regular time intervals. This value may be determined from a calibration procedure in which an identical time-varying signal is applied to all channels and interchannel time differences are estimated, or more commonly it may be taken from the manufacturer’s specifications for the digitizing system used. For example, for a system which samples successive channels at regular time intervals t, the time skew of channel number n would be (n‑1)t. The actual time of sampling (digitization) of sample number m of channel number n in such a system would be R + (m-1)/f + (n-1)t, where R is the reference time at the start of the epoch and f is the channel sampling frequency (t &lt; 1/f).</p>

<p>Definition: This data type is used for labeling of digital waveform data. It defines a recording channel, which is associated with one of the values in each time sample of waveform data. Each channel has a number (which generally defines its position in a multichannel display) and an optional name or label (also used in displays). One or two named waveform sources may also be associated with a channel (providing for the use of differential amplifiers with two inputs). The other components of the channel definition data type are optional. The individual components are defined as follows:</p>
<h4 id="section-4"></h4>
<h4 id="channel-identifier-wvi">Channel Identifier (WVI)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the number and name of the recording channel where waveform data is transmitted. </p>
<h4 id="waveform-source-wvs">Waveform Source (WVS)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component identifies the source of the waveform connected to the channel. Two names may be specified if it is necessary to individually identify the two inputs for a waveform. Only one name need be specified if the channel is connected to a single input. For example, in EKG recordings typically only one name is used (such as I or II); in electroencephalography, two names are typically used, one for each input of the differential amplifier (such as F3 and C3).</p>
<h4 id="channel-sensitivity-and-units-csu">Channel Sensitivity and Units (CSU)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component defines the channel sensitivity (gain) and the units in which it is measured.</p>
<h4 id="channel-calibration-parameters-ccp">Channel Calibration Parameters (CCP)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component identifies the corrections to channel sensitivity, the baseline, and the channel time skew.</p>
<h4 id="channel-sampling-frequency-nm">Channel Sampling Frequency (NM)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component defines the sampling frequency in hertz of the channel, that is, the reciprocal of the time in seconds between successive samples. Note that this is the frequency of transmitted data, which may or may not be the actual frequency at which the data was acquired by an analog-to-digital converter or other digital data source (i.e. the data transmitted may be subsampled, or interpolated, from the originally acquired data.)</p>
<h4 id="minimum-and-maximum-data-values-nr">Minimum and Maximum Data Values (NR)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component defines the minimum and maximum data values which can occur in this channel in the digital waveform data, that is, the range of the ADC. , and also specifies whether or not non-integral data values may occur in this channel in the waveform data. If the minimum and maximum values are both integers (or not present), only integral data values may be used in this channel. If either the minimum or the maximum value contains a decimal point, then non-integral as well as integral data values may be used in this channel. For an n-bit signed ADC, the nominal baseline B = 0, and the minimum (L) and maximum (H) values may be calculated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>L = -2n<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>H = 2n<sup>-1</sup> - 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an unsigned n-bit ADC, the minimum value L = 0, and the nominal baseline value (B) and maximum value (H) may be calculated from the formulas,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B = 2n<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>H = 2n - 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual signal amplitude A (for differentially amplified potential measurements, the potential at electrode number one minus that at electrode number two) may be calculated from the value D (range L to H) in the waveform data using the actual baseline value B and the nominal sensitivity S and actual sensitivity correction factor C by the formula,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A = SC(D-B)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the CF data type.</p>
<p>Definition: This data type transmits codes and the formatted text associated with the code. This data type can be used to transmit for the first time the formatted text for the <strong>canned text</strong> portion of a report, for example, a standard radiological description for a normal chest X‑ray. The receiving system can store this information and in subsequent messages only the identifier need be sent. Another potential use of this data type is transmitting master file records that contain formatted text. This data type has six components as follows:</p>
<p>The components, primary and alternate, are defined exactly as in the CE data type with the exception of the second and fifth components, which are of the formatted text data type.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the CNE data type.</p>
<p>Definition: Specifies a coded element and its associated detail. The CNE data type is used when a required or mandatory coded field is needed. The specified HL7 table or imported or externally defined coding system must be used and may not be extended with local values. Text may not replace the code. A CNE field must have an HL7 defined or external table associated with it. A CNE field may be context sensitive such that a choice of explicit coding systems might be designated. This allows for realm and other types of specificity. Every effort will be made to enumerate the valid coding system(s) to be specified in the 3rd component, however, the standards body realizes that this is impossible to fully enumerate.</p>
<p>Note: The presence of two sets of equivalent codes in this data type is semantically different from a repetition of a CNE-type field. With repetition, several distinct codes (with distinct meanings) may be transmitted.</p>
<p>Example 1: The drug must be coded and must be taken from the specified coding system. The coding system is an external coding system. Example is derived from <em>FT1-26</em>.</p>
<p>|0006-0106-58^Prinivil 10mg oral tablet^NDC|</p>
<p>Example 2: Consent mode must be coded and must be taken from the specified coding system. The coding system is an HL7 code table. Example is taken from <em>CON-10</em>.</p>
<p>|V^Verbal^HL70497^^^^2.8|</p>
<h4 id="section-6"></h4>
<h4 id="identifier-st-1">Identifier (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: The first component contains the sequence of characters (the code) that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <em>CNE.2</em>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Note</strong>: The identifier is required and must be a valid code.</p>
<h4 id="text-st">Text (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: The second component contains the descriptive or textual name of the identifier, e.g., myocardial infarction or X-ray impression. This is the corresponding text assigned by the coding system to the identifier.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Note</strong>: Text description of code is optional but its use should be encouraged since it makes messages easier to review for accuracy, especially during interface testing and debugging.</p>
<h4 id="name-of-coding-system-id-1">Name of Coding System (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: The third component contains the code for the name of the coding system from which the value in <em>CNE.1</em> is obtained. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70396"><em>HL7 Table 0396 - Coding Systems</em></a> in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values. Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier.</p>
<p>As of v2.7 this component is required when <em>CNE.1</em> is populated and <em>CNE.14</em> is not populated. Both <em>CNE.3</em> and <em>CNE.14</em> may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in <em>CNE.3</em> and/or <em>CNE.14</em> the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the <strong>identifier</strong> and <strong>name of coding system</strong> represent a unique concept for a data item.</p>
<p>Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the <em><strong>name of coding system</strong></em> component is defined as <em><strong>HL7nnnn</strong></em> where <em><strong>nnnn</strong></em> is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Note:</strong> <strong>The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7.</strong> Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states &quot;<em>Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values</em>”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard. This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.</p>
<h4 id="alternate-identifier-st-1">Alternate Identifier (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: A sequence of characters that uniquely identifies an alternate code. Analogous to <em>CNE.1</em> <em>Identifier</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The Alternate Identifier is used to represent the local or user seen code as described. If present, it obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for component 1. If both are present, the identifiers in component 4 and component 1 should have exactly the same meaning, i.e., they should be exact synonyms.</p>
<h4 id="alternate-text-st">Alternate Text (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: The descriptive or textual name of the alternate identifier. Analogous to <em>CNE.2 Text</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> If present, <em>CNE.5</em> obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for <em>CNE.2</em>.</p>
<h4 id="name-of-alternate-coding-system-id-1">Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: Identifies the coding scheme being used in the alternate identifier component. Analogous to <em>CNE.3 Name of Coding System</em>.

<p>As of v2.7 this component is required when <em>CNE.4</em> is populated and <em>CNE.17</em> is not populated. Both <em>CNE.6</em> and <em>CNE.17</em> may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in <em>CNE.6</em> and/or <em>CNE.17</em>, the &quot;Coding System&quot; component or the &quot;Coding System OID&quot;, for the tuple.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> If present, <em>CNE.6</em> obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for <em>CNE.3</em>.</p>
<h4 id="coding-system-version-id-st-1">Coding System Version ID (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: the version ID for the coding system identified by <em>CNE.3</em>. It belongs conceptually to components 1-3 and appears here only for reasons of backward compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Note:</strong> If the coding system is any system other than an &quot;HL7 coding system,&quot; version ID must be valued with an actual version ID. If the coding system is &quot;HL7 coding system,&quot; version ID may have an actual value or it may be absent. If version ID is absent, it will be interpreted to have the same value as the HL7 version number in the message header. Text description of code is optional but its use should be encouraged since it makes messages easier to review for accuracy, especially during interface testing and debugging.</p>
<h4 id="alternate-coding-system-version-id-st-1">Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: the version ID for the coding system identified by <em>CNE.6</em>. It belongs conceptually to the group of Alternate components (see note <em>2.A.1</em>) and appears here only for reasons of backward compatibility. Analogous to <em>CNE.7 Coding System Version ID</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> If present, <em>CNE.8</em> obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for <em>CNE.7</em>.</p>
<h4 id="original-text-st-1">Original Text (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: The text as seen and/or selected by the user who entered the data. Original text can be used in a structured user interface to capture what the user saw as a representation of the code on the data input screen, or in a situation where the user dictates or directly enters text, it is the text entered or uttered by the user. In a situation where the code is assigned sometime after the text was entered, original text is the text or phrase used as the basis for assigning the code.</p>

Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70396"><em>HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System</em></a> in Chapter 2C, section &quot;Coding System Table&quot; for valid values. Analogous to <em>CSU.4 Unit of Measure Coding System</em>.</p>
<p>This field is required if the <em>CSU.5 Alternate Unit of Measure Identifier</em> is present. Both <em>CSU.7</em> and <em>CSU.18</em> may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in <em>CSU.7</em> and/or <em>CSU.18</em>, the &quot;Coding System&quot; component or the &quot;Coding System OID&quot; for the tuple.</p>
<h4 id="unit-of-measure-coding-system-version-id-st">Unit of Measure Coding System Version ID (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component carries the version for the coding system identified by components 2-4. If <em>CSU.4</em> is populated with a value other than HL7nnnn or is of table type user-defined, version ID must be valued with an actual version ID. If <em>CSU.4</em> is populated with a value of HL7nnnn and nnnn is of table type HL7, version ID may have an actual value or it may be absent. If version ID is absent, it will be interpreted to have the same value as the HL7 version number in the message header.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the CWE data type.</p>
<p>Definition: Specifies a coded element and its associated detail. The CWE data type is used when 1) more than one table may be applicable <strong>or</strong> 2) the specified HL7 or externally defined table may be extended with local values <strong>or</strong> 3) when text is in place, the code may be omitted.</p>
<p>The presence of two sets of equivalent codes in this data type is semantically different from a repetition of a CWE-type field. With repetition, several distinct codes (with distinct meanings) may be transmitted.</p>
<p><span id="CWE_UsageNote" class="anchor"></span><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The CWE data type should be used for coded fields with one or more of the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The identifier code (CWE.1) component is optional</p></li>
<li><p>The set of allowable values from which the identifier code is drawn may be extended on a site-specific basis</p></li>
<li><p>An exception identifier code may be encountered; that is, a code that is not defined in the value set (either model or site-extended).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is in contrast to the CNE data type, which requires a code from a non-extendable value set be sent in the identifier code component (CNE.1) in all cases (except, of course, if the entire field is empty and defined as optional at the segment level).</p>
<p>The rules for populating CWE components are governed by the status of the identifier code:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Identifier Code Status</strong></td>
<td><strong>Identifier Code (CWE.1)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Descriptive Text (CWE.2)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Coding System (CWE.3)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Contained in model value set</td>
<td>Populated</td>
<td>May be populated</td>
<td>Must be populated with model coding system, or (not recommended) site-specific coding system that is a superset containing model values.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Contained in site-specific extensions to model value set</td>
<td>Populated</td>
<td>May be populated</td>
<td>Site-specific coding system.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Contained in neither model nor extended value sets</td>
<td>Not populated</td>
<td>May be populated with the identifier code, free-text description, or a concatenation of the two. Should be human interpretable.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Not supplied; but descriptive text is supplied.</td>
<td>Not populated</td>
<td>May be populated with descriptive text.</td>
<td>Must not be populated.</td>

</table>
<p>As an example, consider “currency” codes where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The model values are defined by the ISO 4217 value set,</p></li>
<li><p>The value set is extended on site to include the code HL7 – “HL7 Drink Ticket”, and</p></li>
<li><p>The data entry screen on the sending system does not enforce any edits for the currency code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And so the value set used on site is:</p>
<table>

<tr class="odd">

<p><strong>Code</strong></p></td>

<p>Definition: The third component contains the code for the name of the coding system from which the value in <em>CWE.1</em> is obtained. Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier. As of v2.7 this component is required when <em>CWE.1</em> is populated and <em>CWE.14</em> is not populated. Both <em>CWE.3</em> and <em>CWE.14</em> may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field.

<p>Definition: A digit, or digits, exclusive of the identifier in <em>CX.1</em>, calculated by applying an algorithm to all or some of the digits in the number, which may be used to test validity of the non-check-digit identifier.</p>
<h4 id="check-digit-scheme-id">Check Digit Scheme (ID)</h4>

<p>The algorithm for calculating a Mod10 check digit is as follows:</p>
<p>Assume you have an identifier - 12345. Take the odd digit positions, counting from the right, i.e., 531, multiply this number by 2 to get 1062. Take the even digit positions, starting from the right (i.e., 42), prepend these to the 1062 to get 421062. Add all of these six digits together to get 15. Subtract this number from the next highest multiple of 10, i.e., 20 - 15 to get 5. The Mod10 check digit is 5. The Mod10 check digit for 401 is 0; for 9999, it’s 4; for 99999999, it’s 8.</p>
<p>The algorithm for calculating a Mod11 check digit is as follows:</p>

<h4 id="assigning-authority-hd">Assigning Authority (HD)</h4>
<p>The assigning authority is a unique name of the system (or organization or agency or department) that creates the data. As of v2.7, <em>CX.4 Assigning Authority</em> is required if neither <em>CX.9</em> nor <em>CX.10</em> are populated. Best practice is to always send an OID in the Assigning Authority component</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="D:\\Data\\SROs\\HL7\\V2\\V282\\V281_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70363"><em>User-defined Table 0363 - Assigning Authority</em></a> for suggested values.</p>
<p>The reader is referred to the <em>CX.9</em> and the <em>CX.10</em> if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued. If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in <em>CX.9</em> and/or <em>CX.10</em> conflict with <em>CX.4</em>, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70300"><em>User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID</em></a> (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.<br />

<h4 id="identifier-type-code-id">Identifier Type Code (ID)</h4>
<p>A code corresponding to the type of identifier. As of v2.7, <em>CX.5 Identifier Type Code</em> is required. Refer to <a href="D:\\Data\\SROs\\HL7\\V2\\V282\\V281_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70203"><em>HL7 Table 0203 – Identifier Type</em></a> for suggested values.</p>
<h4 id="assigning-facility-hd">Assigning Facility (HD)</h4>
<p>Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient. This component is not an inherent part of the identifier but rather part of the history of the identifier: as part of this data type, its existence is a convenience for certain intercommunicating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70300"><em>User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID</em></a> (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component), may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.</p>

</ul>
<p>The reader is referred to the <em>CX.4</em> if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.</p>
<h4 id="assigning-agency-or-department-cwe">Assigning Agency or Department (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: The agency or department that assigned the identifier in component 1. As of v2.7, Assigning Agency or Department is required if neither <em>CX.4</em> nor <em>CX.9</em> are populated.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70530"><em>User-defined Table 0530 – Organizations, agency, department</em></a> for suggested values if the administrative unit under whose jurisdiction the identifier was issued is an organization, agency or department. This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when <em>CX.5 Identifier Type Code</em> may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are <strong>not</strong> recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.</p>
<p>Example 1: &lt;Identifier&gt; plus &lt;Visa&gt; yields a unique identifier.</p>
<p>Example 2: &lt;identifier&gt; plus &lt;state&gt; plus &lt;DLN&gt; yields a unique driver’s license number.</p>
<p>Example 3: &lt;identifier&gt; plus &lt;country&gt; plus &lt;INS&gt; yields a unique immigration number.</p>
<p>The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.</p>

<p>The time zone (+/-ZZZZ) is represented as +/-HHMM offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (formerly Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)), where +0000 or -0000 both represent UTC (without offset). The specific data representations used in the HL7 encoding rules are compatible with ISO 8824-1987(E).</p>
<p>Note that if the time zone is not included, the time zone defaults to that of the local time zone of the sender. Also note that a DTM valued field with the HHMM part set to &quot;0000&quot; represents midnight of the night extending from the previous day to the day given by the YYYYMMDD part (see example below).

<p>The HL7 Standard strongly recommends that all systems routinely send the time zone offset but does not require it. All HL7 systems are required to accept the time zone offset, but its implementation is application specific. For many applications the time of interest is the local time of the sender. For example, an application in the Eastern Standard Time zone receiving notification of an admission that takes place at 11:00 PM in San Francisco on December 11 would prefer to treat the admission as having occurred on December 11 rather than advancing the date to December 12.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The time zone [+/-ZZZZ], when used, is restricted to legally-defined time zones and is represented in HHMM format.</p>
<p>One exception to this rule would be a clinical system that processed patient data collected in a clinic and a nearby hospital that happens to be in a different time zone. Such applications may choose to convert the data to a common representation. Similar concerns apply to the transitions to and from daylight saving time. HL7 supports such requirements by requiring that the time zone information be present when the information is sent. It does not, however, specify which of the treatments discussed here will be applied by the receiving system.</p>
<p>The DTM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the DTM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of dates and times.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in the context where the DTM type is used, the DTM type may be truncated to a day. When a DTM is truncated, the truncated form SHALL still be a valid DTM type. Systems should always be able to persist full date / time information including the timezone. Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.5.5.2 &quot;Truncation Pattern&quot; for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The entity identifier defines a given entity within a specified series of identifiers.</p>
<p>The EI is appropriate for, but not limited to, machine or software generated identifiers. The generated identifier goes in the first component. The remaining components, 2 through 4, are known as the assigning authority; they identify the machine/system responsible for generating the identifier in component 1.</p>
<p>The specified series, the assigning authority, is defined by components 2 through 4. The assigning authority is of the hierarchic designator (HD) data type, but it is defined as three separate components in the EI data type, rather than as a single component as would normally be the case. This is in order to maintain backward compatibility with the EI’s use as a component in several existing data fields. Otherwise, the components 2 through 4 are as defined in Section <em>2.A.33</em>, &quot;<em>HD - hierarchic designator</em>&quot;. Hierarchic designators (HD) are unique across a given HL7 implementation.</p>

<p>Definition: This data type is derived from the TX data type by allowing the addition of embedded formatting instructions. These instructions are limited to those that are intrinsic and independent of the circumstances under which the field is being used. The actual instructions and their representation are described in section 2.7.6, “Usage and Examples of Formatted Text”. <em><strong>The FT field is of arbitrary length (up to 64k)</strong></em> and may contain formatting commands enclosed in escape characters.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>|\.sp\(skip one vertical line)|</p>
<p>For additional examples of formatting commands see Section 2.7, &quot;Use of Escape Sequences in Text Fields&quot;.</p>
<p>To include alternative character sets, use the appropriate escape sequence. See Chapter 2, &quot;Control&quot;, section 2.15.9.18, &quot;Character set&quot; and section 2.14.9.20, &quot;Alternate character set handling scheme&quot;.</p>
<p>This specification applies no limit to the length of the FT data type, either here where the data type is defined, or elsewhere where the data type is used. While there is no intrinsic reason to limit the length of this data type for semantic or syntactical reasons, it is expected that some sort of limitation will be imposed for technical reasons in implementations. HL7 recommends that implementation length limits are published in implementation profiles. The contents of an FT field may be truncated, but the truncation pattern does not apply.</p>

<p>Definition: The basic definition of the HD is that it identifies an (administrative or system or application or other) entity that has responsibility for managing or assigning a defined set of instance identifiers (such as placer or filler number, patient identifiers, provider identifiers, etc.). This entity could be a particular health care application such as a registration system that assigns patient identifiers, a governmental entity such as a licensing authority that assigns professional identifiers or drivers’ license numbers, or a facility where such identifiers are assigned.</p>
<p>The HD is designed to be a more powerful and more general replacement for the application identifier of HL7 versions 2.1 and 2.2. It adds two additional components, the &lt;universal ID&gt; and the &lt;universal ID type&gt; to the former application ID (which is renamed more generically to be the namespace ID).</p>
<p>In the case where an HD identifies an entity that assigns/creates instance identifiers such as a particular patient registration system, it defines an &quot;assigning authority&quot;. In the case where an HD identifies a location where instance identifiers are given out (although they may be created by another entity at another location) such as a particular &quot;department of motor vehicles office location,&quot; it defines an &quot;assigning facility&quot;. These two different uses of the HD appear in many of the extended data types.</p>
<p>The &quot;assigning authority&quot; defined by the HD is similar in its role to the coding system (and version) part of the coded element data types: both identify a set of more discrete instance identifiers. The difference is that the set of HD-defined discrete instances contain identifiers of &quot;real-world&quot; things such as patient or clinical orders, while the coded element-defined set of discrete instances contains concept identifiers (codes).</p>
<p>The HD is designed to be used either as a local identifier (with only the &lt;namespace ID&gt; valued) or a publicly-assigned identifier, a UID (&lt;universal ID&gt; and &lt;universal ID type&gt; both valued). Syntactically, the HD is a group of two identifiers: a local identifier defined by the first component and a universal identifier defined by the second and third components. HDs that have defined third components (defined UID types) must have a second component that is unique within the series of IDs defined by that component.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The HD is used in fields that in earlier versions of HL7 used the IS data type. Thus, a single component HD (only the first component valued) will look like a simple IS data type for older systems expecting a single component in the place of the HD data type.</p>
<p>If the first component for the HD data type is present, the second and third components are optional. If the third component is present, then the second must also be present (although in this case the first is optional). The second and third components must either both be valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null). </p>
<p>This means that if all three components of the HD are valued, the entity identified by the first component is the same as the entity identified by components two and three taken together. However, implementers may choose, by site agreement, to specify that if all three components of the HD are valued, the first component defines a member in the set defined by the second and third components.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Example 1: ISO example with only the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> components valued:</p>
<p>|^2.16.840.1.113883.19^ISO|</p>
<p>The syntax of the second component is defined by the ISO standard for object identifiers, not by HL7 (for which the second component is of the ST data type). Thus the periods (&quot;.&quot;) in the second component are part of the ISO syntax, and are legal by the definition of the HL7 ST data type.</p>
<p>Example 2: A UUID example</p>
<p>|^478A0114-EBF0-7701-A023-6841FF05731A^UUID|</p>
<p>Example 3: A DNS example</p>
<p>|^falcon.iupui.edu^DNS|</p>
<p><strong>Local examples:</strong></p>
<p>Example 4: Local use only: a HD that looks like an IS data type</p>
<p>|LAB1|</p>
<p>|RX.PIMS.SystemB.KP.CA.SCA|</p>
<p>Note that the syntax of the first component is not defined by HL7 but by the site according to its own needs: the only requirement is that the first component’s structure is allowed by the HL7 string (ST) data type, which is used for values by the IS data type.</p>
<p>Example 5: Local identifier using components 2 and 3 only <em><span class="underline">(Deprecated as of v2.8)</span></em></p>
<p>|^RX.PIMS.SystemB.CA.SCA^M|</p>
<p>An alternate way to encode the previous example, illustrating the use of the third component value of &quot;M&quot; (see <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70301"><em>HL7 Table 0301 - Universal ID type</em></a> below) to identify a locally-defined identifier set. The second component has the same value as the previous example but is now defined to be a member of a set of allowable values defined by a site for the identifier set “M”. <span class="underline"> <em>The use of local coding schemes as Universal ID Types is deprecated as of v 2.8; assigning authorities should be identified with true Universal IDs.</em></span></p>
<p>Example 6: local identifier and universal ID types:</p>
<p>|LAB1^2.16.840.1.113883.19.1.2.3.3.4.6.7^ISO|</p>
<p>A HD with an ISO &quot;object Identifier&quot; as a UID and a locally defined system name. Both the first component and the second and third (taken together) refer to the same entity. This example shows that the local value and the universal ID value may be transmitted with a single HD field.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the HD is used in a given segment (either as a field or as a component of another data type) this table may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.</p>
<h4 id="universal-id-st-1">Universal ID (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: The HD’s second component, &lt;universal ID&gt; (UID), is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, &lt;universal ID type&gt; (UID type). The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined. Each UID must belong to one of the specifically enumerated schemes for constructing UIDs (defined by the UID type). The UID (second component) must follow the syntactic rules of the particular universal identifier scheme (defined by the third component). Note that these syntactic rules are not defined within HL7 but are defined by the rules of the particular universal identifier scheme (defined by the third component).</p>
<h4 id="universal-id-type-id-1">Universal ID Type (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: The third component governs the interpretation of the second component of the HD.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the IS data type.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Length:</strong> ≥ 1- Varies - dependent on length of shortest code in code set.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Length:</strong> Varies - dependent on length of longest code in code set.</p>
<p>As of v2.7, the only approved use of the IS data type is in the <em>HD.1</em>, <em>EI.2</em> and <em>PL.6</em> plus a limited number of fields where a determination could not readily be made as to whether the item is an identifier or an actual coded item. Additionally, in accordance with chapter 2 rules, any field or data type component marked as &quot;Retained for backward compatibility&quot; will retain any IS data type.</p>
<p>The value of such a field follows the formatting rules for a ST field except that it is drawn from a site-defined (or user-defined) table of legal values. There shall be an HL7 table number associated with IS data types. An example of an IS field is the Event reason code defined in Chapter 3, &quot;Patient Administration&quot;, section 3.4.1.4, &quot;Event reason code&quot;. This data type should be used only for user-defined tables (see Chapter 2C, &quot;Code Tables&quot;, section 2.C.1.1, &quot;User-defined Tables&quot;). The reverse is not true, since in some circumstances, it is more appropriate to use the CWE data type for user-defined tables.</p>
<p>It is never acceptable to truncate an IS value.</p>

<p>Definition: This data type is used to represent channel-multiplexed waveform data. Assuming that fields that utilize this data type repeat and that Y represents the specific repetition, the components of the repetition will reflect sample Y from each channel.</p>
<p>Usage Note: The MA data type is preferred when the signal recording device outputs the waveform data by time (all signal amplitudes at time sample 1, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 2, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 3, etc.). The typical count is 32, 64, or 128 channels. At the time of this writing, the MA data type is the one used by most commercial EEG instruments, while other electrophysiological instruments (such as evoked potential instruments) may use the NA data type. The MA data type is the &quot;natural&quot; one for multi-channel EEG instruments since the signal acquisition process involves digitizing each channel in succession as rapidly as possible, then after a fixed interval (like 0.004 seconds) digitizing all the channels again in succession, and repeating this every 0.004 seconds as long as the recording continues.</p>
<p>Conversion of one format to another is often not possible or desirable in near-real-time applications. For example, a long-term EEG recording may go on for 24, 48, 72, or more hours and implementations cannot wait until the recording is ended to transmit the data because physicians need to review the waveforms as the recording is in progress; this is why it only makes sense to organize the data by the MA data type which sends the data one time sample after the next.</p>
<p>Note that, visually, the NA and MA data types are indistinguable: they both appear as a series of numeric components. They are distinguished by context, particularly when used in <em>OBX.5</em> where the data type is specified in <em>OBX.3</em>.</p>
<p>Use Case: Commercial EEG instruments</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> 3 channels (identical), 6 time-samples</p>
<p>|0^0^0~1^1^1~2^2^2~3^3^3~4^4^4~5^5^5|</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> 1 channel, 11 time-samples</p>
<p>|0~1~2~3~4~5~6~7~8~9~10|</p>

Also, by allowing the field to repeat, a two-dimensional array (table) of numbers may be transmitted using this format, with each row of the table represented as one repetition of the field. Arrays that have one or more values not present may be transmitted using this data type. &quot;Not present&quot; values are represented as two adjacent component delimiters. If the absent values occur at the end of a row, the trailing component delimiters may be omitted. If an entire row of a table has no values, no component delimiters are necessary (in this case, there will be two adjacent repetition delimiters).</p>

<p>Definition: A number represented as a series of ASCII numeric characters consisting of an optional leading sign (+ or -), the digits and an optional decimal point. In the absence of a sign, the number is assumed to be positive. If there is no decimal point the number is assumed to be an integer.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Length:</strong> 1</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Length:</strong> 16</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>|999|</p>
<p>|-123.792|</p>
<p>|0.1|</p>
<p>Values of this data type shall contain at least one digit to the left of the decimal point. This means that 0.1 is a valid representation, while .1 is not. Leading zeros, or trailing zeros after a decimal point, are not significant. For example, the following two values with different representations, &quot;01.20&quot; and &quot;1.2,&quot; are identical. Except for the optional leading sign (+ or -) and the optional decimal point (.), no non-numeric ASCII characters are allowed. Thus, the value &lt;12 should be encoded as a structured numeric (SN) (preferred) or as a string (ST) (allowed, but not preferred) data type.</p>
<p>The NM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the NM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of numbers.</p>
<p>Values of type NM may always have leading zeros truncated. Note that HL7 recommends that leading zeros not be used. Unless NM is used to represent a monetary amount, implementations may truncate trailing zeros after the decimal point up to the first non-zero digit or the decimal point, which ever comes first. Any digits to the left of the decimal point may never be truncated (other than leading zeros).</p>
<p>Example: 1.0200 may be truncated to 1.02, but not to 1.0.</p>

<p>Definition: This data type is used to specify a patient location within a healthcare institution. Which components are valued depends on the needs of the site. For example for a patient treated at home, only the person location type is valued. It is most commonly used for specifying patient locations, but may refer to other types of locations within a healthcare setting.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This data type contains several location identifiers that should be thought of in the following order from the most general to the most specific: facility, building, floor, point of care, room, bed.<br />
Additional data about any location defined by these components can be added in the following components: person location type, location description and location status.</p>
<p>Example: Nursing Unit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A nursing unit at Community Hospital: 4 East, room 136, bed B</p>

<p>This data type is the equivalent of an XCN data type joined with a DTM data type. However, the XCN data type has been flattened to allow legal expression of its embedded complex data types HD, CWE and CWE.</p>
<h4 id="section-40"></h4>
<h4 id="person-identifier-st">Person Identifier (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component carries the Person Identifier itself. <em>PPN.1</em>, in conjunction with <em>PPN.9</em>, uniquely identifies the entity/person.</p>
<h4 id="family-name-fn">Family Name (FN) </h4>
<p>Definition: This component allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as &quot;van&quot; or &quot;de&quot;) from the surname root. See section <em>2.A.30</em>, &quot;<a href="#_FN_-_family_name"><em>FN – Family Name</em></a>&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="given-name-st-1">Given Name (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: First name.</p>
<h4 id="second-and-further-given-names-or-initials-thereof-st-1">Second and Further Given Names or Initials Thereof (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Multiple middle names may be included by separating them with spaces.</p>
<h4 id="suffix-st-1">Suffix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify a name suffix (e.g., Jr. or III).</p>
<h4 id="prefix-st-1">Prefix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify a name prefix (e.g., Dr.).</p>
<h4 id="degree">Degree </h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>The PPN.7 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v2.7</em> See <em>PPN.22 - Professional Suffix</em>.</p>
<h4 id="source-table-cwe">Source Table (CWE)</h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>Retained for backwards compatibility only as of v2.7.</em> The reader is referred to <em>PPN.9</em> instead.</p>
<p><a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70297"><em>User-defined Table 0297 - CN ID Source</em></a> is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component. Used to delineate the first component.</p>
<h4 id="assigning-authority-hd-1">Assigning Authority (HD)</h4>
<p>Definition: The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency of department) that creates the data. It is a HD data type. <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70363"><em>User-defined Table 0363 – Assigning Authority</em></a> is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for the first sub-component of the HD component, &lt;namespace ID&gt;.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70300"><em>User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID</em></a> (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.</p>

<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>As of v 2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional.</em> It is required if <em>PPN.1</em> is populated and neither <em>PPN.23</em> nor <em>PPN.24</em> are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.</p>
<p>The reader is referred to the <em>PPN.23</em> and the <em>PPN.24</em> if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued. If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in <em>PPN.23</em> and/or <em>PPN.24</em> conflict with <em>PPN.9</em>, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.</p>
<h4 id="name-type-code-id">Name Type Code (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: A code that represents the type of name. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70200"><em>HL7 Table 0200 - Name Type</em></a> for valid values (see Section <em>2.A.90</em>, “<em>XPN - extended person name</em>”).</p>
<h4 id="identifier-check-digit-st-1">Identifier Check Digit (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: A digit, or digits, exclusive of the identifier in <em>CX.1</em>, calculated by applying an algorithm to all or some of the digits in the number, which may be used to test validity of the non-check-digit identifier.</p>
<h4 id="check-digit-scheme-id-1">Check Digit Scheme (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: Contains the code identifying the check digit scheme employed.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70061"><em>HL7 Table 0061 - Check Digit Scheme</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="identifier-type-code-id-1">Identifier Type Code (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: A code corresponding to the type of identifier. In some cases, this code may be used as a qualifier to the &quot;Assigning authority&quot; component. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70203"><em>HL7 Table 0203 - Identifier Type</em></a> for suggested values.</p>
<h4 id="assigning-facility-hd-1">Assigning Facility (HD)</h4>
<p>Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient. This component is not an inherent part of the identifier but rather part of the history of the identifier: as part of this data type, its existence is a convenience for certain intercommunicating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70300"><em>User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID</em></a> (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.</p>
<h4 id="datetime-action-performed-dtm">Date/Time Action Performed (DTM)</h4>
<p>This component describes when the activity was performed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If this field is not null, both the performing person and the time stamp must be valued.</p>
<h4 id="name-representation-code-id">Name Representation Code (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: Different name/address types and representations of the same name/address should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the Name/Address Type and/or Name/Address Representation component.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This new component remains in “alphabetic” representation with each repetition of the field using these data types. That is, even though the name may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.</p>
<p>In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.</p>
<h4 id="name-context-cwe">Name Context (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component is used to designate the context in which a name is used. The main use case is in Australian healthcare: indigenous patients who prefer to use different names when attending different healthcare institutions. Another use case occurs in the US where health practitioners can be licensed under slightly different names and the reporting of the correct name is vital for administrative purposes. Refer to chapter 3, section 3.4.2.6 for more detailed information on how to use this table. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70448"><em>User-defined Table 0448 – Name Context</em></a> for suggested values.</p>
<h4 id="name-validity-range">Name Validity Range</h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>The PPN.18 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7.</em> Refer to <a href="#effective-date-dtm-2"><em>PPN.20 Effective Date</em></a> and <a href="#expiration-date-dtm"><em>PPN.21 Expiration Date</em></a>.</p>
<h4 id="name-assembly-order-id">Name Assembly Order (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: A code that represents the preferred display order of the components of this person name. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70444"><em>HL7 Table 0444 – Name Assembly Order</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="effective-date-dtm-2">Effective Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The first date, if known, on which the person name is valid and active.</p>
<h4 id="expiration-date-dtm">Expiration Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The last date, if known, on which the person name is valid and active.</p>
<h4 id="professional-suffix-st">Professional Suffix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify an abbreviation, or a string of abbreviations, denoting qualifications that support the person’s profession, (e.g., licenses, certificates, degrees, affiliations with professional societies, etc.). The Professional Suffix normally follows the Family Name when the Person Name is used for display purposes. Please note that this component is an unformatted string and is used for display purposes only. Detailed information regarding the contents of Professional Suffix is obtained using appropriate segments in Chapter 15, &quot;Personnel Management&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="assigning-jurisdiction-cwe-1">Assigning Jurisdiction (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: The geo-political body that assigned the identifier in component 1.</p>
<p>See section <em>2.A.14.9</em>, &quot;<em>Assigning Jurisdiction (CWE)</em>&quot; for further detail.</p>
<h4 id="assigning-agency-or-department-cwe-1">Assigning Agency or Department (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: The agency or department that assigned the identifier in component 1.</p>
<p>See section <em>2.A.14.10</em>, &quot;<em>Assigning Agency or Department (CWE)</em>&quot; for further details.</p>
<h4 id="security-check-st-1">Security Check (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component is used to communicate a version code that may be assigned to the value given in <em>PPN.1 - Person Identifier</em>.</p>
<h4 id="security-check-scheme-id-1">Security Check Scheme (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component is used to transmit information intended to validate the veracity of the supplied identifier or the presenter of the identifier. For example, this component may be used to ensure that the presenter of a credit card is an authorized user of that card.</p>

<p>Definition: Uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to the current order, together with the information in <em>OBR-29 - Parent</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Note:</strong> This data type is applied only to <em>OBR-26 - Parent Result</em> where it serves to make information available for other types of linkages (e.g., toxicology). This important information, together with the information in <em>OBR-29 - Parent</em>, uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result that identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization.</p>
<p>We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.</p>
<p>This field is present only when the parent result is identified by <em>OBR-29 - Parent</em> and the parent spawns child orders for each of many results. See Chapter 7, &quot;Observations&quot;, for more details about this linkage.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Replaces the CM data type used in sections 4.5.3.26 - OBR-26 and 7.4.1.26 - OBR-26 as of v 2.5.</p>

<h4 id="parent-observation-sub-identifier-og">Parent Observation Sub-identifier (OG)</h4>

<h4 id="section-44"></h4>
<h4 id="segment-field-name-st">Segment Field Name (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component contains the segment field name.</p>
<p>Naming conventions:</p>
<p>Segment field names are designated by the “@” symbol concatenated with the HL7 segment ID followed by the sequence number for the field separated by a period. See sections 2.5.2, &quot;Segments and segment groups&quot; and 2.5.3.1, &quot;Position (sequence within the segment)&quot; for a definition of segment ID and sequence number. If the field is divided into components, the designation may be suffixed with &quot;.nn&quot;, to identify a particular component (a suffix of “.3” indicates the third component of the field); otherwise, the whole field is assumed. If the field is further divided into subcomponents, the designation is suffixed with “.nn.mm&quot;, which identifies the component and subcomponent requested by relative position.</p>
<p>Site-specific segment field names may be used<strong>.</strong> In this case, the site-specific segment ID (if the field is not being added to an existing HL7 segment) and the sequence number must be defined so that they do not conflict with existing HL7 segment IDs and field sequence numbers.</p>
<p>Values for this field are defined in the function-specific chapters of this specification.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the “@” is being used as one of the delimiter characters defined in MSH-2-encoding characters, it must be “escaped.” See Section 2.7.1, &quot;Formatting Codes&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="values-st">Values (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component contains the field value or values in the form &quot;value1&amp; value2 &amp; value3...&quot;</p>
<p>A single-valued parameter contains only a single subcomponent in the second component, thus no subcomponent delimiters are needed (e.g., &lt;segment field name&gt; ^ &lt;value&gt;). A simple list of values (i.e., a one-dimensional array) may be passed instead of a single value by separating each value with the subcomponent delimiter (e.g., &lt;segment field name&gt; ^ &lt;value1 &amp; value2 &amp;...&gt;).</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>When applied to strings, the relational operators LT, GT, LE, and GE imply an alphabetic comparison.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>A &quot;generic&quot; comparison selects a record for inclusion in the response when the beginning of the designated field matches the select string.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Where a repeating field is specified as an operand, a match on any instance of that field qualifies the row for inclusion in the response message.</p>

<p>Definition: Describes a reference range and its supporting detail.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><blockquote>
<p>A range that applies unconditionally, such as albumin, is transmitted as:</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>|3.0&amp;5.5|</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>A normal range that depends on sex, such as Hgb, is transmitted as:</p>

<p>|13.5&amp;18^M~12.0 &amp; 16^F|</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">

<p>When no value is specified for a particular component, the range given applies to all categories of that component. For example, when nothing is specified for race/species, the range should be taken as the human range without regard to race. If no age range is specified, the normal range given is assumed to apply to all ages.</p>
<h4 id="section-47"></h4>
<h4 id="numeric-range-nr">Numeric Range (NR)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the numeric interval of the reference data. Range is taken to be inclusive (i.e., the range includes the end points). Units are context sensitive and are defined in the usage note for the field where this data type is used.</p>
<h4 id="administrative-sex-cwe">Administrative Sex (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies which gender for which the reference range is valid. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70001"><em>User-defined Table 0001 – Administrative Sex</em></a> in Chapter 2C, section 3.4.2.8, &quot;Administrative Sex&quot; for suggested values.</p>
<h4 id="age-range-nr">Age Range (NR)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the age range for which the reference range is valid. Ages of less than one year should be specified as a fraction (e.g., 1 month = 0.0830, 1 week = 0.01920, 1 day = 0.0027300). However, for most purposes involving infants, the gestational age (measured in weeks) is preferred. The lower end of the range is not indicated; the upper end is, assuring that series of ranges do not overlap.</p>
<h4 id="gestational-age-range-nr">Gestational Age Range (NR)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the gestational age range for which the reference range is valid. Gestational age is relevant only when the reference range is influenced by the stage of pregnancy. The gestational age is measured in weeks from conception. For example, |1&amp;4| implies that the normals apply to gestational ages from 1 week to 4 weeks inclusive. The lower end of the range is not included; the upper end is, assuring that series of age ranges do not overlap.</p>
<h4 id="species-tx">Species (TX)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the species for which the reference range is valid. Species is assumed to be human unless otherwise stated. Example values are rabbit, mouse, and rat.</p>
<h4 id="racesubspecies-st">Race/subspecies (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the race or subspecies for which the reference range is valid. In the case of humans (the default species), the race is specified when race influences the reference range. When normal ranges for animals are being described, this component can be used to describe subspecies or special breeds of animals.</p>
<h4 id="conditions-tx">Conditions (TX)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies any arbitrary condition for which the reference range is valid. This may include such conditions as phase of menstrual cycle or dose of a particular drug. It is provided as a way to communicate the normal ranges for special conditions. It does not allow automatic checking of these text conditions.</p>

<p>The first component may repeat, with repeat values separated by a space. The repeats are interpreted as connected by logical ANDs.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Twice per day, every other day: BID QOD</p>
<p>Three times per day, Monday Wednesday and Friday: TID QJ135</p>
<p>Because of this syntax, repeat values should never contain blanks.</p>
<h4 id="explicit-time-interval-st">Explicit Time Interval (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component explicitly lists the actual times referenced by the code in the first component, in the following format: HHMM,HHMM,HHMM,.... This second component will be used to clarify the first component in cases where the actual times vary within an institution. If the time of the order spans more than a single day, this new component is only practical if the same times of administration occur for each day of the order. If the actual start time of the order (as given by the fourth component of the quantity/timing field) is after the first explicit time, the first administration is taken to be the first explicit time after the start time. In the case where the patient moves to a location having a different set of explicit times, the existing order may be updated with a new quantity/timing field showing the changed explicit times.</p>

<p>Definition: A unique designator of the system that stores the data. It is an HD data type (See Section <em>2.A.33</em>, &quot;<em>HD - hierarchic designator</em>&quot;). Application ID’s must be unique across a given HL7 implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Note:</strong> The Application ID together with the Pointer may form a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in accordance with RFC 2396. In this case the Application ID shall include the Scheme and Authority parts of the URI, and the Path part if that points to an application. The Pointer shall include the Query part of the URI, or the Path part if that points to an object. All delimiters between URI parts (“:”, “/”, “?”) should be included in the components.</p>
<p>Referenced data may be obtained by a mechanism not defined in the HL7 standard. The Scheme part of a URI in the Application ID specifies the access protocol, e.g., HTTP or FTP.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A CDA document accessed by FTP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|/cdasvc/u28864099/s9076500a/e77534/d55378.xml^&amp;ftp://www.saintelsewhere.org&amp;URI^text^x-hl7-cda-level-one|</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A DICOM image accessed by HTTP and converted to JPEG (using the ISO/DICOM WADO standard); note that ampersands in the Pointer string are escaped to “\T\” to avoid conflict with the sub-component delimiter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|?requestType=WADO\T\study=1.2.840.113848.5.22.9220847989\T\series=1.2.840.113848.5.22.922084798.4\T\object=1.2.840.113848.5.22.922084798.4.5^&amp;https://www.pacs.poupon.edu/wado.jsp&amp;URI^image^jpeg|</p>

<p>Definition: The repeat pattern data type should be used where it is necessary to define the frequency at which an event is to take place. This data type provides a way to define repeat pattern codes &quot;on the fly&quot;. The repeat pattern code is equivalent to the TQ data type, component 2, sub-component 1 (repeat pattern). The additional components define the meaning of the repeat pattern code. Components 2 - 10 are used to define relatively simple repeat patterns. Component 11 is provided to define complex repeat patterns. This data type forms a bridge between the 2.x Repeat Pattern concept from Quantity/Timing, and the Version 3.0 GTS General Timing Specification. Component 1 is the 2.x concept of repeat pattern. Components 2-7 are derived from the version 3.0 data type PIVL. Components 8-10 are derived from the version 3.0 EIVL data type. If a repeat pattern cannot be defined using components 2-10, then component 11, General Timing Specification is provided. This allows the full literal form of the version 3.0 GTS to be specified.</p>
<p>When using the RPT, if an application doesn't recognize the code in component 1, then it may attempt to determine the appropriate frequency using the remaining components. If the application does recognize the code in component 1, the application is not required to determine the frequency from the remaining components.</p>
<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: The use case supporting this proposal is the need to define repeat patterns on the fly while placing an order. The TQ data type did not have the capability to define the meaning of a repeat pattern on the fly. To get around this problem, vendors have implemented a variety of solutions to solve this issue. One way was to add Z-components to the TQ data type to transmit information about the repeat pattern. Another solution was to attempt to parse the repeat pattern code in an attempt to decipher what the code meant.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The structured numeric data type is used to unambiguously express numeric clinical results along with qualifications. This enables receiving systems to store the components separately, and facilitates the use of numeric database queries. The corresponding sets of values indicated with the &lt;comparator&gt; and &lt;separator/suffix&gt; components are intended to be the authoritative and complete set of values. If additional values are needed for the &lt;comparator&gt; and &lt;separator/suffix&gt; components, they should be submitted to HL7 for inclusion in the Standard.</p>
<p>If &lt;num1&gt; and &lt;num2&gt; are both non-null, then the separator/suffix must be non-null. If the separator is &quot;-&quot;, the data range is inclusive; e.g., &lt;num1&gt; - &lt;num2&gt; defines a range of numbers x, such that: &lt;num1&gt; &lt;=x&lt;= &lt;num2&gt;.</p>

<p>Definition: Specifies those parameters by which the response will be sorted and by what method.</p>
<p>Example: In a tabular response query, where the return data is known by column name, the SRT might look like:</p>
<p>|LastName^A~FirstName^A|</p>
<p>Example: In a segment response query, where the return data is known by segment and offset, the SRT field would use segment field name notation:</p>
<p>|PID.3.1^A~PID.3.2|</p>
<h4 id="section-56"></h4>
<h4 id="sort-by-field-st">Sort-by Field (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Identifies the field by which the response will be sorted. In a tabular response, this will be the column name to sort by. In the Segment Pattern and the Display Response, this will be the segment field name to sort by. See QIP in Section <em>2.A.60.1</em>, &quot;<em>Segment Field Name (ST)</em>&quot; for segment field name definition.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The String data type is used for text data when the appearance of text does not bear meaning. This is true for formalized text, symbols and formal expressions, and all kinds of names intended for machine processing (e.g., sorting, querying, indexing, etc.).</p>
<p>String data is left justified (i.e., no leading blank space) with trailing blanks optional. Any displayable (printable) ACSII characters (hexadecimal values between 20 and 7E, inclusive, or ASCII decimal values between 32 and 126), except the defined escape characters and defined delimiter characters.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> <strong>1</strong>: A textual ST field:</p>
<p>|almost any data at all|</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: URL encoded in an ST component:</p>
<p>^http://www.pacs.poupon.edu/wado.jsp^</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong>: ISO OID encoded in an ST subcomponent:</p>
<p>&amp;2.16.840.1.113883.1.1&amp;</p>
<p>To include any HL7 delimiter character (except the segment terminator) within a string data field, use the appropriate HL7 escape sequence (see Section 2.7.1, &quot;Formatting Codes”).</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Length</strong>: Not specified for the type. May be specified in the context of use. Defaults to 1</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Length</strong>: Not specified for the type. May be specified in the context of use</p>
<p>ST has no inbuilt semantics – these are assigned where the ST is used. In each case where ST is used, minimum, maximum, and conformance lengths may be specified. Unless specified in the context of use, values of type ST may not be truncated.</p>
<p><strong>Usage note:</strong> The ST data type is intended for short strings (e.g., less than 1000 characters). For longer strings the TX or FT data types should be used (see Sections <em>2.A.80</em>, “<em>TX - text data</em>” or <em>2.A.31</em>, “<em>FT - formatted text data</em>”).</p>
<p><strong>Alternate character set note:</strong> ST - string data may also be used to express other character sets. See Section 2.15.9.18, &quot;Character set,&quot; and Section 2.15.9.20, &quot;Alternate character set handling&quot; for details.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Specifies the hour of the day with optional minutes, seconds, fraction of second using a 24-hour clock notation and time zone.</p>
<p>As of v 2.3, the number of characters populated (excluding the time zone specification) specifies the precision.</p>
<p>Format: HH[MM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]</p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>the first two are used to specify a precision of &quot;hour”</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="15" type="a">
<li><p>the first four are used to specify a precision of &quot;minute”</p></li>
<li><p>the first six are used to specify a precision of &quot;second”</p></li>
<li><p>the first eight are used to specify a precision of &quot;one tenth of a second”</p></li>
<li><p>the first eleven are used to specify a precision of &quot; one ten thousandths of a second”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Example: |0630| specifies 6: 30 AM.</p>
<p>The fractional seconds could be sent by a transmitter who requires greater precision than whole seconds. Fractional representations of minutes, hours or other higher-order units of time are not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The time zone [+/-ZZZZ], when used, is restricted to legally-defined time zones and is represented in HHMM format.</p>
<p>The time zone of the sender may be sent optionally as an offset from the coordinated universal time (previously known as Greenwich Mean Time). Where the time zone is not present in a particular TM field but is included as part of the date/time field in the MSH segment, the MSH value will be used as the default time zone. Otherwise, the time is understood to refer to the local time of the sender.</p>

<p>Prior to v 2.3, this data type was specified in the format HHMM[SS[.SSSS]][+/-ZZZZ]. As of v 2.3 minutes are no longer required. By site-specific agreement, HHMM[SS[.SSSS]][+/-ZZZZ] may be used where backward compatibility must be maintained.This corresponds a minimum length of 4.</p>
<p>The TM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the TM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of times.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in the context where the DTM type is used, the DTM type may be truncated to a particular minute. When a TM is truncated, the truncated form SHALL still be a valid TM type. Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.5.5.2, &quot;Truncation Pattern&quot;, for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> String data meant for user display (on a terminal or printer). Such data would not necessarily be left justified since leading spaces may contribute greatly to the clarity of the presentation to the user. Because this type of data is intended for display, it may contain certain escape character sequences designed to control the display. Escape sequence formatting is defined in Section 2.7, &quot;Use of escape sequences in text fields&quot;. Leading spaces should be included. Trailing spaces should be removed.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>| leading spaces are allowed.|</p>
<p>Since TX data is intended for display purposes, the repeat delimiter, when used with a TX data field, implies a series of repeating lines to be displayed on a printer or terminal. Therefore, the repeat delimiters are regarded as paragraph terminators or hard carriage returns (e.g., they would display as though a CR/LF were inserted in the text (DOS type system) or as though a LF were inserted into the text (UNIX style system)).</p>
<p>A receiving system would word‑wrap the text between repeat delimiters in order to fit it into an arbitrarily sized display window but start any line beginning with a repeat delimiter on a new line.</p>
<p>To include alternative character sets, use the appropriate escape sequence. See Chapter 2, section 2.14.9.18, &quot;MSH-18 - Character Set&quot; and section 2.14.9.20, &quot;MSH-20 - Alternate Character Set Handling Scheme&quot;.</p>
<p>This specification applies no limit to the length of the TX data type, either here where the data type is defined, or elsewhere where the data type is used. While there is no intrinsic reason to limit the length of this data type for semantic or syntactical reasons, it is expected that some sort of limitation will be imposed for technical reasons in implementations. HL7 recommends that implementation length limits be published in implementation profiles.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> This data type specifies the address of a person, place or organization plus associated information.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Replaces the AD data type as of v2.3.</p>
<p>Example of usage for US:</p>
<p>|1000 Hospital Lane^Ste. 123^Ann Arbor ^MI^99999^USA^B^^WA^|</p>
<p>This would be formatted for postal purposes as</p>
<p>1000 Hospital Lane</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ste. 123</p>
<p>Ann Arbor MI 99999</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example of usage for Australia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|14th Floor^1000 Hospital Lane^Sidney^QLD^9999|</p>
<p>This would be formatted for postal purposes using the same rules as for the American example as</p>
<p>14th Floor</p>
<p>1000 Hospital Lane</p>
<p>Sidney QLD 9999</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>International note:</strong> Countries typically have a standard method of formatting addresses. This data type does not specify the formatting usages, only the components of a postal address.</p>
<h4 id="section-63"></h4>
<h4 id="street-address-sad">Street Address (SAD)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component contains the house number, apartment number, street name, street direction, P.O. Box number, and similar address information.</p>
<h4 id="other-designation-st-1">Other Designation (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component contains the second line of address. In US usage, it qualifies address. Examples: Suite 555 or Fourth Floor. When referencing an institution, this component specifies the street address.</p>
<h4 id="city-st-1">City (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the city, or district or place where the addressee is located depending upon the national convention for formatting addresses for postal usage.</p>
<h4 id="state-or-province-st-1">State or Province (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the state or province where the addressee is located. State or province should be represented by the official postal service codes for that country.</p>
<h4 id="zip-or-postal-code-st-1">Zip or Postal Code (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the zip or postal code where the addressee is located. Zip or postal codes should be represented by the official codes for that country. In the US, the zip code takes the form 99999[-9999], while the Canadian postal code takes the form A9A9A9, and the Australian Postcode takes the form 9999.</p>
<h4 id="country-id-1">Country (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the country where the addressee is located. HL7 specifies that the 3-character (alphabetic) form of ISO 3166 be used for the country code. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70399"><em>HL7 Table 0399 – Country Code</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="address-type-id-1">Address Type (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies the kind or type of address. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70190"><em>HL7 Table 0190 - Address Type</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<p><em>XAD.7</em> is required if there are multiple occurrences of XAD in a field.</p>
<h4 id="other-geographic-designation-st-1">Other Geographic Designation (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component specifies any other geographic designation. It includes county, bioregion, SMSA, etc.</p>
<h4 id="countyparish-code-cwe">County/Parish Code (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: A code that represents the county in which the specified address resides. <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70289"><em>User-defined Table 0289 - County/parish</em></a> is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component. When this component is used to represent the county (or parish), component 8 &lt;other geographic designation&gt; should not duplicate it (i.e., the use of &lt;other geographic designation&gt; to represent the county is allowed only for the purpose of backward compatibility, and should be discouraged in this and future versions of HL7).</p>
<p>Allowable values: codes defined by government.</p>
<h4 id="census-tract-cwe">Census Tract (CWE)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Definition: A code that represents the census tract in which the specified address resides. <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70288"><em>User-defined Table 0288 - Census Tract</em></a> is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allowable Values: codes defined by government.</p>
<h4 id="address-representation-code-id">Address Representation Code (ID) </h4>
<p>Definition: Different &lt;name/address types&gt; and representations of the same name/address should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the &lt;name/address type&gt; and/or &lt;name/address representation&gt; component.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Also note that this new component remains in &quot;alphabetic&quot; representation with each repetition of the fields using these data types. I.e. even though the address may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70465"><em>HL7 Table 0465 – Name/address Representation</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<p>In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.</p>
<h4 id="address-validity-range-dr">Address Validity Range (DR)</h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>The XAD.12 component was retained for backward compatibility as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v2.7.</em> Refer to <em>2.A.87.13</em>, &quot;<em>Effective Date</em> (DTM)&quot; and <em>2.A.87.14</em>, &quot;<em>Expiration Date</em> (DTM)&quot; components.</p>
<h4 id="effective-date-dtm-3">Effective Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The first date, if known, on which the address is valid and active for the ‘owning’ entity.</p>
<h4 id="expiration-date-dtm-1">Expiration Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The last date, if known, on which the address is valid and active for the ‘owning’ entity.</p>
<h4 id="expiration-reason-cwe">Expiration Reason (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: This identifies why this address was marked as &quot;ended&quot;. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70616"><em>User-defined Table 0616 – Address Expiration Reason</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="temporary-indicator-id">Temporary Indicator (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: If &quot;Y&quot; this indicates that the address is considered temporary. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70136"><em>HL7 Table 0136 – Yes/No Indicator</em></a>.</p>
<h4 id="bad-address-indicator-id">Bad Address Indicator (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: If &quot;Y&quot;, this indicates that it is not possible to contact the &quot;owning&quot; entity at this address. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70136"><em>HL7 Table 0136 – Yes/No Indicator</em></a>.</p>
<h4 id="address-usage-id">Address Usage (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: This indicates how the address is intended to be used. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70617"><em>User-defined Table 0617 – Address Usage</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="addressee-st">Addressee (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Identifies the name of the person or organization that should appear as part of the address. This is also known as the &quot;Care of&quot; or &quot;C/O&quot; line.</p>
<h4 id="comment-st">Comment (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Descriptive information about the use of the address.</p>
<p>Example: &quot;Do not ring bell.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="preference-order-nm">Preference Order (NM)</h4>
<p>Definition: For an entity having multiple addresses, indicates which is the 'most preferred' (lowest number) to 'least preferred' (highest number).</p>
<p>If the preference order is unique across all usages for a given type, then it indicates the preference across all usages, (e.g., first try my home address, then my business address). Otherwise, the preference order is assumed to only apply within a specific usage.</p>
<p>Preference order numbers need not be sequential (i.e., four addresses with the priority orders of 10, 1, 5 and 15 are legitimate). The preference order numbers must be non-negative.</p>
<h4 id="protection-code-cwe">Protection Code (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: Identifies that an address needs to be treated with special care or sensitivity.</p>
<p>The specific set of codes and appropriate handling of such addresses will vary by jurisdiction and is subject to site-specific negotiation. For example, a provider address marked as 'unlisted' might not be printed in an internal address listing. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70618"><em>User-defined Table 0618 – Protection Code</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="address-identifier-ei">Address Identifier (EI)</h4>
<p>Definition: A unique identifier for the address.</p>
<p>This component allows an address to be uniquely identified, and enables the linking of a single address to multiple people and contexts. For example, each member of a family living at the same location would share the same address, having the same identifier. A correction to the address of one family member could be automatically propagated to other members of the family.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Replaces CN data type as of v 2.3.</p>
<p>This data type is used extensively appearing in the PV1, ORC, RXO, RXE, OBR and SCH segments, as well as others, where there is a need to specify the ID number and name of a person.</p>
<p>Example without assigning authority and assigning facility:</p>
<p>|1234567^Everyman^Adam^A^III^DR^PHD^ADT01^^L^4^M11^MR|</p>
<p>Examples with assigning authority and assigning facility:</p>
<p>Dr. Harold Hippocrates’ provider ID was assigned by the Provider Master and was first issued at Good Health Hospital within the Community Health and Hospitals System. Since IS table values (first component of the HD) were not used for assigning authority and assigning facility, components 2 and 3 of the HD data type are populated and demoted to sub-components as follows:</p>
<p>12188^Hippocrates^Harold^H^IV^Dr^MD^^&amp;Provider Master.Community Health and Hospitals&amp;L^L^9^M10^DN^&amp;Good Health Hospital.Community Health and Hospitals&amp;L^A</p>
<p>Ludwig van Beethoven's medical record number was assigned by the Master Patient Index and was first issued at Fairview Hospital within the University Hospitals System.</p>

<h4 id="section-64"></h4>
<h4 id="person-identifier-st-1">Person Identifier (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component carries the Person Identifier itself. XCN.1, in conjunction with XCN.9 uniquely identifies the entity/person.</p>
<p><em>XCN.1</em> is required if <em>XCN.2</em> is not populated. Both may be populated.</p>
<h4 id="family-name-fn-1">Family Name (FN) </h4>
<p>Definition: This component allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as &quot;van&quot; or &quot;de&quot;) from the surname root. See section <em>2.A.30</em>, &quot;<em>FN - family name</em>&quot;.</p>
<p><em>XCN.2</em> is required if <em>XCN.1</em> is not populated. Both may be populated.</p>
<h4 id="given-name-st-2">Given Name (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: First name.</p>
<h4 id="second-and-further-given-names-or-initials-thereof-st-2">Second and Further Given Names or Initials Thereof (ST) </h4>
<p>Definition: Multiple middle names may be included by separating them with spaces.</p>
<h4 id="suffix-st-2">Suffix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify a name suffix (e.g., Jr. or III).</p>
<h4 id="prefix-st-2">Prefix (ST) </h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify a name prefix (e.g., Dr.).</p>
<h4 id="degree-1">Degree </h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>The XCN-7 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v27..</em> Refer to <em>XCN.21 Professional Suffix.</em></p>
<h4 id="source-table-cwe-1">Source Table (CWE)</h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> Retained for backwards compatibility only as of v 2.7. The reader is referred to <em>XCN.9</em> instead.</p>
<p><a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70297"><em>User-defined Table 0297 – CN ID</em></a> source is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component. Used to delineate the first component.</p>
<h4 id="assigning-authority-hd-2">Assigning Authority (HD)</h4>
<p>Definition: The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency of department) that creates the data. <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70363"><em>User-defined Table 0363 – Assigning Authority</em></a> is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for the first sub-component of the HD component, &lt;namespace ID&gt;.</p>
<p>As of v 2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional. It is required if <em>XCN.1</em> is populated and neither <em>XCN.22</em> nor <em>XCN.23</em> are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.</p>
<p>The reader is referred to <em>XCN.22</em> and <em>XCN.23</em> if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued. If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in <em>XCN.22</em> and/or <em>XCN.23</em> conflict with <em>XCN.9</em>, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Replaces PN data type as of v 2.3.</p>
<p><strong>Internationalization Note:</strong> In countries using ideographic or syllabic (phonetic) character sets, it is sometimes necessary to send the name in one or both of these formats, as well as an alphabetic format. The switching between the different character sets can be accomplished using a character set such as JIS X 0202 - ISO 2022 which provides an escape sequence for switching among different character sets and among single-byte and multi-byte character representations. When the name field is repeated, the different repetitions of the name may be represented by these different character sets. The details are as follows. (See also Section 2.9.2, “Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets for PN, XPN, XCN, XON, XAD, FT, ST and TX data types.”)</p>
<p>HL7 supports the following standards for Japanese characters:</p>
<p>JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 13 (Japanese Katakana)</p>
<p>JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 14 (Japanese Romaji)</p>
<p>JIS X 0208 for ISO-IR 87 (Japanese Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana)</p>
<p>JIS X 0212 for ISO-IR 159 (supplementary Japanese Kanji)</p>
<p>HL7 supports the following standards for European characters:</p>
<p>ISO 8859 (1-9) for ISO-IR 100, 101, 109, 110, 144,127, 126, 138 and 148.</p>
<p>Character sets are referenced in HL7 as ASCII, 8859/1,8859/2, ISO IR14, ISO IR87, and ISO IR159. DICOM uses codes laid out in ISO 2375, of the form 'ISO-IR xxx'. HL7 supports this naming as well, to facilitate interoperability.</p>
<p>HL7 uses the Basic G0 Set of the International Reference Version of ISO 646:1990 (ISO IR-6) as the default character repertoire for character strings. This is a single-byte character set, identical to ASCII.</p>
<p>Each repetition of a XPN, XON, XCN, or XAD field is assumed to begin with the default character set. If another character set is to be used, the HL7 defined escape sequence used to announce that character set must be at the beginning of the repetition, and the HL7 defined escape sequence used to start the default character set must be at the end of the repetition. Note also that several character sets may be intermixed within a single repetition as long as the repetition ends with a return to the default character set.</p>
<p>An application must specify which character sets it supports in the field <em>MSH-18 Character Sets</em> and which character set handling scheme it supports in the field <em>MSH-20 Alternate Character Set Handling Scheme</em>. It is assumed that the sending and receiving applications are aware of how to map character set names (i.e., ISO-IR xxx) to escape sequences.</p>
<p>For example, in many Japanese messages there is a mix of Romaji (i.e., Roman characters), Katakana (phonetic representation of foreign words), Hiragana (phonetic representation of Japanese words) and Kanji (pictographs). Such a message would require 4 character sets be specified in the MSH.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="section-66"></h4>
<h4 id="family-name-fn-2">Family Name (FN) </h4>
<p>Definition: This component allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as &quot;van&quot; or &quot;de&quot;) from the surname root. See section <em>2.A.30</em>, &quot;<em>FN - family name</em>&quot;.</p>
<p><em>XPN.1</em> will be empty when <em>XPN.7</em> is MSK. It MAY be empty when <em>XPN.7</em> is NAV.</p>
<p>Usage Note: If a person’s name has only one component, that name will be sent in <em>XPN.1 Family Name</em>. This is common practice in some countries such as Indonesia. This note does not cover the case where only one part of a person's multi-part name is known (e.g., only know &quot;John&quot; of &quot;John Doe&quot;).</p>
<h4 id="given-name-st-3">Given Name (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: First name.</p>
<h4 id="second-and-further-given-names-or-initials-thereof-st-3">Second and Further Given Names or Initials Thereof (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Multiple middle names may be included by separating them with spaces.</p>
<h4 id="suffix-st-3">Suffix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify a name suffix (e.g., Jr. or III).</p>
<h4 id="prefix-st-3">Prefix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify a name prefix (e.g., Dr.).</p>
<h4 id="degree-2">Degree </h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>The XPN-6 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7.</em> See <em>XPN.14 Professional Suffix</em>.</p>
<h4 id="name-type-code-id-2">Name Type Code (ID) </h4>
<p>Definition: A code that represents the type of name. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70200"><em>HL7 Table 0200 - Name Type</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The content of Legal Name is country specific. In the US the legal name is the same as the current married name.</p>
<h4 id="name-representation-code-id-3">Name Representation Code (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: Different &lt;name/address types&gt; and representations of the same &lt;name/address&gt; should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the &lt;name/address type&gt; and/or &lt;name/address representation&gt; component.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This new component remains in &quot;alphabetic&quot; representation with each repetition of the field using these data types, i.e., even though the name may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70465"><em>HL7 Table 0465 – Name/address Representation</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<p>In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.</p>
<h4 id="name-context-cwe-2">Name Context (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: This component is used to designate the context in which a name is used. The main use case is in Australian healthcare for indigenous patients who prefer to use different names when attending different healthcare institutions. Another use case occurs in the US where health practitioners can be licensed under slightly different names and the reporting of the correct name is vital for administrative purposes. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70448"><em>User-defined Table 0448 – Name Context</em></a> for suggested values.</p>
<h4 id="name-validity-range-2">Name Validity Range </h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>The XPN.10 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v2.7.</em> Refer to 2.A.90.12, &quot;Effective Date (DTM)&quot; and 2.A.90.13, &quot;Expiration Date (DTM)&quot; components.</p>
<h4 id="name-assembly-order-id-2">Name Assembly Order (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: A code that represents the preferred display order of the components of this person name. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70444"><em>HL7 0444 – Name Assembly Order</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="effective-date-dtm-5">Effective Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The first date, if known, on which the person name is valid and active.</p>
<h4 id="expiration-date-dtm-3">Expiration Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The last date, if known, on which the person name is valid and active.</p>
<h4 id="professional-suffix-st-2">Professional Suffix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Used to specify an abbreviation, or a string of abbreviations denoting qualifications that support the person’s profession, (e.g., licenses, certificates, degrees, affiliations with professional societies, etc.). The Professional Suffix normally follows the Family Name when the Person Name is used for display purposes. Please note that this component is an unformatted string and is used for display purposes only. Detailed information regarding the contents of Professional Suffix is obtained using appropriate segments in Chapter 15, Personnel Management.</p>
<h4 id="called-by-st">Called By (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: A &quot;called by&quot; name is the name that is preferred when a person is directly addressed; sometimes known as a nickname.</p>
<p>Note: The called by component contains a name that could be categorized as a nickname using the name usage types in <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70200"><em>HL7 Table 0200 - Name type</em></a>. Its use is reserved for instances in which the nickname is a single name part that is provided in addition to a name that has some other type, such as legal. It is understood that the &quot;called by&quot; name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>James Robert Smith is Called By Jim Bob</p></li>
<li><p>James Robert Smith is Called By JR</p></li>
<li><p>Peter Richard Smith is Called By Richard</p></li>
<li><p>Mary Margaret Elizabeth Jones is Called By Meg.</p></li>

<p>Example 2: Telephone number with extension</p>
<p>^WPN^PH^^^734^6777777^1</p>
<p>Example 2: Telephone number with internal code. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports a full external telephone number (area code and telephone number). It also supports internal dialing standards that assign a code to each facility and an extension to each telephone (which happens to be the last 4 digits of the external telephone number, by convention).</p>
<p>So, if the Los Angeles facility were assigned code 333, and if the &quot;outside&quot; telephone number at the LA office is (626) 555-1234, the components would be:</p>

<h4 id="telephone-number">Telephone Number </h4>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> <em>The XTN-1 component was deprecated as of v2.3 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v2.6.</em></p>
<h4 id="telecommunication-use-code-id">Telecommunication Use Code (ID) </h4>
<p>Definition: A code that represents a specific use of a telecommunication number. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70201"><em>HL7 Table 0201 - Telecommunication Use Code</em></a> for valid values. This component along with <em>XTN.3</em> describes the nature of the telecommunication data that follows. Best practice requires the population of <em>XTN.2</em> when <em>XTN.4</em> or <em>XTN.7</em> is populated.</p>
<h4 id="telecommunication-equipment-type-id">Telecommunication Equipment Type (ID)</h4>
<p>Definition: A code that represents the type of telecommunication equipment. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70202"><em>HL7 Table 0202 - Telecommunication Equipment Type</em></a> for valid values. This component along with <em>XTN.2</em> describes the nature of the telecommunication data that follows and is necessary to accurately interpret it.</p>
<h4 id="communication-address-st">Communication Address (ST)</h4>
<p>This component is required if, and only allowed if, XTN.7 or XTN.12 are not populated. Note: If any of the HL7 delimiters are found in the Communication Address, such as @, the appropriate HL7 escape sequence SHALL be used when encoding an Internet address (see Chapter 2, &quot;Control&quot;, section 2.7.1, &quot;Formatting Codes&quot;).</p>
<h4 id="country-code-snm">Country Code (SNM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The numeric code assigned by the <a href="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/International_Telecommunication_Union">International Telecommunication Union</a> in standard <a href="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/E.164">E.164</a> to access telephone services in another country. For example, &quot;+1&quot; is the country code for the United States, &quot;+49&quot; is the code for Germany.</p>
<h4 id="areacity-code-snm">Area/City Code (SNM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The numeric code to access telephone services in another area/city within a country. This number historically needs not be dialed if the caller is located in the same area/city as the phone number of the called party.</p>
<p>The use and size of area/city codes is however country specific: some countries do not use area/city codes, or the use of area/city codes may be mandatory when dialing, or area/city codes may be used to group phone numbers based on other criteria than geographic location, such as cell-phone area/city-codes, or free information numbers (e.g., 800 numbers).</p>
<p>Most countries have a prefix for Area/City codes which only has to be dialed if one doesn't use a country code. This prefix (mostly &quot;0&quot;, sometimes &quot;9&quot;) should be omitted from the content of this field. If the prefix for the Area/Code is also mandatory if one uses the country code (e.g., in Italy) then this field should also contain the prefix.</p>
<h4 id="local-number-snm">Local Number (SNM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The numeric code used to contact the called party, exclusive of country and area/city codes. The Local Number is required when, and allowed only if, <em>XTN.4</em> and <em>XTN.12</em> are not populated.</p>
<p>The size of the Local Number is country specific.</p>
<p>Note that the Local Number does not include the numeric codes that have to be dialed once a connection has been established. Examples include (automated) organizational phone systems which allow external callers to dial additional numeric codes. These additional numeric codes should be specified as an extension.</p>
<h4 id="extension-snm">Extension (SNM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The numeric code to contact the called party used within an organization, e.g., the number used if both caller and called party are located within the same organization. The extension is often the same as the last few digits of the Local Number. The use of extensions is country and site specific, and may depend on the type of phone system (PBX) used by the organization.</p>
<h4 id="any-text-st">Any Text (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: Contains comments with respect to the telephone number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: |^^^^^^^^Do not use after 5PM|</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="extension-prefix-st">Extension Prefix (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: The characters established within a company’s internal telephone system network used as a prefix to the Extension component for internal dialing. Note that the use of Extension Prefix requires that the Extension component be valued and that digits, as well as special characters (e.g., *, #) may be used.</p>
<h4 id="speed-dial-code-st">Speed Dial Code (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: The characters established within a company’s internal telephone system used in place of the (external) telephone number to facilitate calling because its length is shorter than that of the telephone number. Note that digits, as well as special characters (e.g., *, #) may be used.</p>
<h4 id="unformatted-telephone-number-st">Unformatted Telephone Number (ST)</h4>
<p>Definition: An expression of the telephone number as an unparsable string. The Unformatted Telephone number is required when, and allowed only if, <em>XTN.4</em> and <em>XTN.7</em> are not populated.</p>
<p>The phone number was entered as free text and sending system does not know how to parse it.</p>
<p>Example: |^^^^^^^^^^^1-800-Dentist|</p>
<h4 id="effective-start-date-dtm">Effective Start Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The first date, if known, on which the telecommunication number is valid and active.</p>
<h4 id="expiration-date-dtm-4">Expiration Date (DTM)</h4>
<p>Definition: The last date, if known, on which the telecommunication number is valid and active.</p>
<h4 id="expiration-reason-cwe-1">Expiration Reason (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: Indicates why this contact number/e-mail was marked as &quot;ended&quot;. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70868"><em>User-defined Table 0868 – Telecommunication Expiration Reason</em></a> for valid values.</p>
<h4 id="protection-code-cwe-1">Protection Code (CWE)</h4>
<p>Definition: Indicates whether this information is considered sensitive or should be protected in some way. Refer to <a href="../V282_Word/%7bFILENAME%20p%7d/V282_CH02C_CodeTables.doc#HL70618"><em>User-defined table 0618 - Protection Code</em></a> for suggested values.</p>
<p>The specific set of codes and appropriate handling of such telecommunications addresses will vary by jurisdiction and is subject to site-specific negotiation. For example, a provider address marked as 'unlisted' might not be printed in an internal address listing.</p>
<h4 id="shared-telecommunication-identifier-ei">Shared Telecommunication Identifier (EI)</h4>
<p>Definition: A unique identifier for the phone number or e-mail address.</p>
<p>This component allows a phone number to be uniquely identified, and enables the linking of a single phone number to multiple people and contexts. For example, each member of a family living at the same location would share the same phone number, having the same identifier. A correction to the phone number of one family member could be automatically propagated to other members of the family.</p>
<p>HL7 does not assume responsibility for the processing rules for this component.</p>
<h4 id="preference-order-nm-1">Preference Order (NM)</h4>
<p>Definition: For an entity having multiple telecommunication addresses, indicates which is the &quot;most preferred&quot; (lowest number) to &quot;least preferred&quot; (highest number).</p>
<p>If the preference order is unique across all usages for a given type, then it indicates the preference across all usages, (e.g. first try my home number, then my business number). If the preference order is unique across all usages and types, then it indicates the preference across all types of telecommunication addresses. (E.g., first try my phone; if that doesn't work, use my pager.) Otherwise, the preference order is assumed to only apply within a specific type and usage.</p>
<p>Preference order numbers need not be sequential (i.e., three numbers with the priority orders of 0, 5 and 15 are legitimate). The preference order numbers must be non-negative.</p>
