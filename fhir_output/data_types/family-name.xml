      <p>Definition: This data type allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as "van" or "de") from the surname root.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Appears ONLY in the PPN, XCN and XPN.</p>

        <p>Definition: Internationalization usage for Germanic languages. This component is optional. An example of a &lt;surname prefix&gt; is the "van" in "Ludwig van Beethoven". Since the &lt;surname prefix&gt; doesn't sort completely alphabetically, it is reasonable to specify it as a separate sub-component of the PN and extended PN data types (XPN and XCN).</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Subcomponents &lt;own surname prefix&gt;, &lt;own surname&gt;, &lt;surname prefix from partner/spouse&gt; and &lt;surname from partner/spouse&gt; decompose complex Germanic names such as “Martha de Mum-van Beethoven”. If these subcomponents are valued, the &lt;surname&gt; subcomponent should still be fully valued for backward compatibility, i.e., ^de Mum-van Beethoven&amp;de&amp;Mum&amp;van&amp;Beethoven^.<br/>
Also, for clarity, the &lt;last name prefix&gt; has been renamed to &lt;own surname prefix&gt;.</p>

        <p>If the person's surname has legally changed to become (or incorporate) the surname of the person's partner or spouse, this is the person's surname immediately prior to such change. Often this is the person's "maiden name".</p>
