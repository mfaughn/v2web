HL7 CODE SYSTEMS AND VALUE SETS

Deprecation indicates that the object has been published and is retained for historical purposes, but should not be used to create new content or revise existing content.

For in-depth information about deprecation, including the process to deprecate an artifact (CodeSystem or ValueSet) or element (such as a concept), please see [link to THO documentation , new section]

Deprecation should not be confused with retirement. Deprecation provides usage guidance specifying that the object SHOULD not be used for new or revised content, whereas retirement indicates it SHALL NOT be used for new or revised content.

Deprecation is an HL7-specific process that provides users of HL7 specifications with guidance for using objects within HL7 implementations. For example, an object may be deprecated if it has been in use for some time and then gets updated or replaced, and guidance is to be provided for what to use instead. This may also be done when planning for an artifact (CodeSystem or ValueSet) to be retired in the near future.

ADD SENTENCE BELOW TO RETIRED TABS FOR HL7 CODE SYSTEM AND VALUE SETS

Retirement has been declared by the HL7 steward of the (CodeSystem or ValueSet) and indicates that the formal status of the resource is no longer active.

Versioning, for example, is a little tricky because each ticket may update the version but when applied sequentially it may not result in the correct number without intervention from the Terminology Curator.

Thank you for the reply. Two follow-up points:

1. I have checked the OID for Passport Numbers stated in the FHIR core spec's identifier system registry (2.16.840.1.113883.4.330) and determined that this OID is actually the parent OID of the actual OIDs which should be used for passport numbers. Further, use of the child OIDs is not mentioned in the identifier registry and thus readers may incorrectly assume that the 2.16.840.1.113883.4.330 OID is to be used for all passports. Do you agree that this is an issue and one which must be resolved as part of the transition of this content to THO?

2. Noting that there are about 249 country codes in the expansion of the  [http://build.fhir.org/valueset-iso3166-1-3.html|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-iso3166-1-3.html,] value set, this will lead to an additional 249 THO identifier system NamingSystem resources in THO as THO does not have a means to represent patterned URIs. Accordingly, this will take a significant amount of time and also has UI implications for the HL7 Terminology website layout.

With the above in mind, Jess and I are interested to hear FHIR-I's thoughts on how we best deal with this in the limited time we have (THO content freeze coming up on 20 February 2022). We see the following options:

1. Remove the identifier registry from the FHIR core spec (in line with  FHIR-35932) and create the 249 THO identifier system NamingSystem resources corresponding to each country passport and apply the correct OID in each.

2. Remove the identifier registry from the FHIR core spec (in line with  FHIR-35932) and postpone creation of the 249 THO identifier system NamingSystem resources (including correction of the OIDs) to the scope of the next release of THO.

Keen you to hear your thoughts or other any other suggestions.

Thank you.","2022-02-08 04:28;lloyd;Presume the resolution will be to create a NamingSystem for every possible country (Wheee....) and each one will have its appropriate OID.  We don't have machinery right now to manage sub-pages for stuff like passports to describe general rules.  So I don't see a whole lot of choice in the short term.  In the intermediate term, we should think about how we might revamp the UI to allow 'grouping' certain subsets of identifiers like passport numbers and US drivers licenses.

I'm not thrilled about the notion of deferring the creation as it creates a risk of someone trying to invent their own.  If you give me a list of the country codes, country numbers and country names (US English) and a base template of what you'd like one to look like, I can write a transform that'll generate the 249 instances.  (At some point, this'll get out of date when some new country comes into being, but we'll worry about that when someone complains.)","2022-02-10 02:01;jsnell;[~lloyd], thank you for your assistance with creating the NamingSystems for each instance. I've attached a spreadsheet to this ticket (Passport Number Identifier Systems.xlsx) that includes the elements that will change across instances. All other elements should remain constant. 

There is an example NamingSystem (passportNumNS-AFG.xml). The file name matches id. 

These entries will also need to be added to the ...\input\sourceOfTruth\control-manifests\identifiers-Rendering.xml manifest and also as special-url values in ...\input\utg.xml. Please reach out if you have any questions. 

Will you be able to commit the changes to the branch used in this ticket? 

Thanks again,

 # The intent of this value set was to include all *ACTIVE* measure type codes and since the code system was designed to only contain measure type concepts, the CLD was ""all the codes in the code system."" The assumption was no problematic changes would ever occur, which we now know should *never* be assumed and we found a code in this code system that was not proper, and needed to be changed to a different code system.
 # While theoretically useful, ""Immutable"" is actually in practice not very useful, even in situations such as this where all codes in the code system is appropriate only when no errors in the code system _will ever occur_. It should not have been used here. The restriction is only problematic and is not implementably useful in any way.

 # The assumption has been among many of us that the default behavior of terminology servers was *to not include inactive codes in expansions unless explicitly included*. The FHIR publisher breaks this assumption - improperly in IMO - and includes the inactive code in the expansion. Therefore this proposal adds the assumed behavior as an explicit ""inactive=False"" that was always assumed to be in the compose.

I have a number of issues with this as it stands:
 * This proposal list the OID for the code system as 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.14914, but the page in the build has the OID = 2.16.840.1.113883.5.104, Which is correct?
 * There are MANY value sets that reference the race code system and when the code system is retired, we need to likely retire all the value sets that reference it, or change them all to reference one of the two active race and ethnicity code systems. It is not clear to me that any of these sub-part value sets are used at all. 

[~marc.duteau] and [~Matt_Elrod] - can you clean this up?","2022-01-07 12:01;tedhl7geek;There seems to be an issue in understanding there.    If you click on the Change Objects link in the proposal, the original object in question is clearly labeled as a Value Set, NOT a code system.   This is at link [http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-Race] 
[https://bitbucket.hl7.org/projects/UTG/repos/utg/commits/6180b4ab38a28d8a30c75de92413555c2da411e6]    A value set is NEVER the source of truth for concepts.    If you examine the CLD, the codes are drawn from code system Include these codes as defined in {{[http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-Race|https://terminology.hl7.org/3.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-Race.html].   Thus it sems that this is actually the object to be deprecated.}}

{{I do see that the v3 code system (an artifact pushlished im the v3 coremif for decades) does have its status set to 'retired', but the change to the manifests to remove it from the active v3 code systems list to the retired code systems list was not done.}}

{{My final point is that UTG ticket change proposal Sponsors should be HL7 Workgroups or HL7 Affiliates except under some special circumstances that must be documented.   This may not be clear in the current instructions; I think since this is a US Realm proposal that the US Realm steering committee WG should be the proposal sponsor (it is fine to indicate that the reason behind it is from needs of BCBSA); there should also be a link in the Description to the minuted decision to approve the ticket.}}

{{}}","2022-01-10 08:33;marc.duteau;The control manifests have been updated to show the file is in the retired list and the ticket is back in consensus review.","2022-01-10 11:51;Rob_McClure;[~marc.duteau] - Sorry, but have you addressed the issues Ted and I identified? Or will [~Matt_Elrod]? As this stands I will vote NEG.","2022-01-10 02:30;marc.duteau;This part of Ted's comment has been addressed:

""{{I do see that the v3 code system (an artifact pushlished im the v3 coremif for decades) does have its status set to 'retired', but the change to the manifests to remove it from the active v3 code systems list to the retired code systems list was not done.}}""

But I don't have the ability to fix and/or address the other issues. [~Matt_Elrod] will have to change the OID in the proposal description as well as the link in the change object field to the code system OID and link, as well as the sponsor stuff.

the codes used in this code system look like the CDCREC codes - I believe that is what happened in V2 - HL7 adopted them for use with the applicable table number. Shoudn't this code system entry point to the CDCREC code system and indicate it should be used instead?

Another question: CDCREC covers both race and ethnicity values - but this is not addressing the ethnicity code system ([https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/branches/UP-263-deprecate-the-race-code-system-in-tho/CodeSystem-v3-Ethnicity.html),] which is a subset of the CDCREC codes.

Concern about the definitions which are not entirely clear.  Discussion about potential update to definitions:

Consider defining patient experience similar to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ):

Patient experience encompasses the range of interactions that patients have with the health care system, including their care from health plans, and from doctors, nurses, and staff in hospitals, physician practices, and other health care facilities. As an integral component of health care quality, patient experience includes several aspects of health care delivery that patients value highly when they seek and receive care, such as getting timely appointments, easy access to information, and good communication with health care providers.

 *  

[https://www.ahrq.gov/cahps/about-cahps/patient-experience/index.html]

 * Consider defining patient engagement as:

""Patient engagement"" is a broader concept that combines patient activation with interventions designed to increase activation and promote positive patient behavior, such as obtaining preventive care or exercising regularly. [https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20130214.898775/full/]

Consider that Experience might be a parent to Patient Experience based on the definition of Experience; Patient Engagement would also be a child.

In the nineties we have done some tweaking to have better ""tables"". This was further improved with the tables project. 

Taking the move to v2+ it is the intent, at least my one and perhaps of others as well, to replace ""tables"" by ""concept/vocabulary domains"", ""value sets"" and ""codesystems"".

Anyhow, this problem introduces the notion to create new codes for a codesystem by applying special rules to another codesystem.  In this case, the code should be ""NN""+<ISO-3166-3-char-code> resulting in ""NNDEU"" for Germany.

A clean solution would be to allow for creating codesystem contents by defining rules based on other codesystems! Another option would be to replace ""NNxxx"" by the set we can generate right now and add codes if necessary. Or we can place an expansion rule in the value set instead of this code, so not to add it to the codesystem, but the value set by inclusion.

However, I support the discussion and an appropriate change proposal.","2021-10-29 07:53;tedhl7geek;Frank, did you look at the link in Published Example above to see the set of codes that Jens is proposing to be added?

 ","2021-11-05 07:32;craig.newman;This is related to a similar issue in table 0396 where HL7xxxx, 99zzz and other code systems need to be expanded (sometimes based on a defined list (eg HL7 table) and sometimes not (eg. 99zzz). Table 0335 also needs a ""pattern"" based solution. There should be a common approach for all of these tables.

For this specific issue, the v2MG supports an expansion of table 0203 to automatically include all possible values based on a rule that prepends all values in the ISO table with ""NN"" to create the list of valid values here.

The InM WG will be reaching out to set up some time to discuss the more general solution.","2021-11-11 09:00;tedhl7geek;[~craig.newman] and [~FrankOemig] please review the proposed new code set - I think there may be some issues as the proposed codes are not consistent with our policy of display names and descriptioins of the concept codes for v2.    ","2021-11-23 09:34;ajulian;This request is not fully filled out:  Many of the columns required are not provided:

I cannot reassign it to anyone and I fail to understand what is missing. It is in consensus review but there are no dates for when the next decision is to be made.","2021-12-14 01:34;tedhl7geek;Jens,

The TSMG has not yet decided how long tickets can languish in Consensus Review before they are returned to the Submitter for rework or socialization to get more support for another try.   I have seen a few notifications of pull requests from Bitbucket - and there are comments above noting some things missing or not consistent with V2 vocabulary policy that wold require changes.   For any change - including and edits you make to content in Bitbucket - you must pull the ticket back to Draft, make the changes, and resubmit it.  This begins the voting with updated content, and notifies all of those that voted already that they should reexamine the ticket with the updated content.    I think you need to make some changes, as your proposed content (viewable through the Published Example link above) is not acceptable to a few of the voters above.    You should absolutely have the permissions to cancel the voting cycle and pull the proposal back to Draft for changes; if you do not please let me know right away.

 ","2021-12-14 01:36;tedhl7geek;In your question to Tony and Riki, all code system concepts  MUST have meaningful display names in addition to the concept codes, and I am pretty sure V2 concepts also require a definition of the concept as well.  Leaving only the code column populated, and/or having the display name not related to the concept but only to part of the concept, I would think is unacceptable.","2021-12-14 04:57;jkiddo;Ehhm.... all the codes have a meaningful display value so what am I missing here?","2021-12-14 04:58;jkiddo;- and with Tony you mean Anthony- and with Riki you mean Ulrike?","2021-12-14 05:14;jkiddo;The NNxxx already states: `National Person Identifier where the xxx is the ISO table 3166 3-character (alphabetic) country code`

-which does in fact describes the concept as a whole. Would you like to have that text duplicated in all 249 concepts? 

-and thinking about it, I don't even think that sentence makes sense. There are many countries that do not have national person identifiers, which actually sort of invalidates the statement in itsef. I'm more and more inclined to suggest that NNxxx should be marked deprecated instead as it is neither directly correct nor a computable value/expresseion.","2021-12-14 08:43;tedhl7geek;Since the code ""NNxxx"" will be removed and only that comment must stay in text somewhere (I don't know where, the v2 folks need to suggest something) just having the names of the countries as the display name does not indicate that the code signifies the national identifier for that country.    That to me is the issue.    ","2021-12-15 01:17;FrankOemig;NNDEU = National Person Identifier for Germany

If that defining URL is stable, perhaps we can use that in the QI-Core update (to be circulated for WG review soon and non-ballot update)?","2021-07-29 07:10;rhausam;What exactly is the rationale for not following the practice that has been defined in the code system of using the code '1' to make an explicit declaration of ""Unreported/Not used"", and instead exclude that code from the value set and omit the element in those cases?","2021-07-29 07:38;mitrep9g;See https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=116465844
Also, we wanted a required binding in http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-qi-core/StructureDefinition-qicore-encounter-diagnosisPresentOnAdmission.html (but not to an ""example"" value set and code system.)

We also plan to relax the cardinality of http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-qi-core/StructureDefinition-qicore-encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.diagnosis.extension:diagnosisPresentOnAdmission to 0..1; making it mandatory (1..1) would have forced ambulatory providers to modify their system (and we would need the ""1"" because ""admission"" is not applicable to them.)  Since it will be optional (change pending) we are not forcing ambulatory providers to add that.  Rather than use ""1"", they simply omit the extension.","2021-08-05 03:14;rhausam;Thanks, Paul.  Unfortunately, when I read through this further explanation (which I've done a few times now) I think it probably makes it maybe even somewhat less clear than it was before - or at least it doesn't seem (to me) to really answer my question.  I still would like to know why it would be preferred to make the element optional and exclude the '1' code from the value set, rather than just using the '1' code as it's provided and made explicit in the code system.","2021-08-05 04:07;mitrep9g;Providers (ambulatory, outpatient) do not have a concept for admission, and their systems do not have anything to assign a ""1"" code or to populate a POA extension in any way. So, if we kept cardinality 1.. and included ""1"" in the valueset (since that would be the only code that makes sense for them), we would be forcing them to make changes to their systems for no good reason.

We changed cardinality to 0.. so we do not force these providers to change their systems; they simply do not add the POA extension.

As I understand it, ""1"" is to be used only on paper forms, so we do not want to allow it in the valueset.

For hospitals or places that do have the concept of admission, we would want them to populate the POA extension, and we do not want them to use ""1""; one of the other codes in that code system should apply.  So we exclude ""1"" from the value set.  

We will probably need to figure out a way to express that the POA extension is mandatory for hospitals and places that have admission, but that will be another issue.  Today for QRDA, there is the HL7 spec, but then CMS publishes its own IG which adds some additional constraints.  We have not gotten to the point where we need a CMS IG on top of a FHIR IG.  For example, a CMS FHIR IG for the IQR program could reference/build on QI-Core and make the cardinality for the POA extension 1...  Maybe there is an invariant that could be added to the HL7 QI-Core IG to express in which cases the POA extension is mandatory, but that will need more work to figure out, and it should not influence this UTG issue.","2021-08-27 02:09;rhausam;I still don't find this explanation and rationale entirely convincing as to why this is the best approach to take.  But any remaining questions/issues that I still have aren't a showstopper for me. ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(Adding a code to a codesystem managed by NIST would not be appropriate for us to do). But this is clearly a need driven code, and the current LOA codes are in an HL7 managed codesystem.

The LOA codes already exist in HL7 in this valueset [https://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet-v3-SecurityTrustObservationValue.html]
Thus your codesystem would be [http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue]

so, just define a new code be added to the existing CodeSystem","2021-04-29 07:13;masnick;Hi [~john_moehrke],

Can you please indicate which code in [http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue] is equivalent to our {{IAL1}} code?

From what I can tell, codes like {{LOAAS1}} may be [authenticator assurance levels|https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sec4] rather than [identity assurance levels|https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html#sec4], though I'm not experienced with these terminologies so I could be missing something.

For example, this splits IAL and AAL: [https://github.com/TransparentHealth/healthcare-trustmark]

Thanks!","2021-04-30 11:40;juliemaas;[~masnick], agree re: what you observe about authenticator vs. identity; that is likely due to 800-63-2 (and prior) combining identity assurance with authentication assurance into a level. I'm actually not seeing the 800-63-3 related codes in that table yet at all. It appears we may need to create not just the 1.2 and 1.4 but also 1, 2, and 3. And due to the split of NIST into IAL/AAL in 800-63-3 there would be different codes for identity and authentication assurance. So it seems the levels to add are IAL, IAL1, IAL1.2, IAL 1.4, IAL2, IAL3, and for those who might need them later (?) AAL, AAL1, AAL2, AAL3.","2021-05-01 09:37;masnick;[~juliemaas], thank you!

Can this be done in a separate code system like {{http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/loa}}? Using the {{v3-ObservationValue}} code system is not ideal for our use case as it may be confusing for implementers considering how many other unrelated codes are part of that.","2021-05-01 11:41;juliemaas;That seems fine to me but [~lcmaas] has just suggested that what may also make sense is to either add codes to [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021May/codesystem-identity-assuranceLevel.html|https://www.hl7.org/fhir/2021May/valueset-identity-assuranceLevel.html] for the newer NIST levels and create an appropriate ValueSet of the new codes for this IG, or create a new, successor version of that CodeSystem specifically for 800-63-3-related codes as we're discussing. If a new CodeSystem is created, it might help if the new CodeSystem name was related to the old CodeSystem name so that it is more obviously a successor.

 ","2021-05-04 02:27;masnick;I updated the Proposal Description above to be clearer about what we're asking for based on the discussion here. Below is the *original* version for easy reference:
{quote}We would like to create http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/loa to identify ""level of assurance"", which are codes representing identity assurance level, based on NIST 800-63-3.

These are the specific codes that should be in this system: http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/CodeSystem-identity-assurance-code-system.html.

There are other LOA codes already a part of UTG: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/284830-smart.2Fhealth-cards/topic/Bundle.20Format/near/236489633

But as Josh Mande said on Zulip (https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/284830-smart.2Fhealth-cards/topic/Bundle.20Format/near/236497486):

> Based on our discussion in #Security and Privacy (https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/284830-smart.2Fhealth-cards/topic/Bundle.20Format/near/236497486) we needed to craft specific new ""intermediate"" LOA codes to capture the fact that most real-world id verifications don't reach IAL2.


Our short-term need is to identify the canonical URI for this new code system, and verify that [these specific codes will be in the system (http://vci.org/ig/vaccination-and-testing/CodeSystem-identity-assurance-code-system.html). This is to support the SMART Health Cards: Vaccination & Testing Implementation Guide (http://vci.org/ig/vaccination-and-testing/), which is currently being actively used by implementers.
{quote}","2021-05-04 03:01;masnick;Based on the discussion above, on Zulip, and on GitHub, I believe everyone is agreed on adding the following codes and descriptions:
|IAL1|Name and birth date were self-asserted.|
|IAL1.2|An unspecified ID was used to verify name and birth date.|
|IAL1.4|A US state-issued photo ID or nationally-issued photo ID was used to verify name and birth date.|
|IAL2|Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required. IAL2 requires identifying attributes to have been verified in person or remotely using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST Special Publication 800-63A.|
|IAL3|In-person identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized CSP representative through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST Special Publication 800-63A.|

In terms of which code system they belong in, there appear to be two viable options mentioned above:
 # Create a new code system called {{[http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/loa]}}
 # Use {{[http://hl7.org/fhir/identity-assuranceLevel]}}

My only concern with using #2 is with the code system name in the URI: this mixes [kebab-case|https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case] with [camelCase|https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CamelCase#English], which will look like a typo to the software engineers who are implementing the IG. It also means that implementers will have to remember whether it's {{identity-assuranceLevel}}, {{identityAssurance-level}}, {{identity-assurance-Level}}, etc., which can lead to bugs. A cleaner name in the URI would be {{identity-assurance-level}} or {{identityAssuranceLevel}}.

The code system URI will appear without context in the JSON representation of our FHIR resources inside SMART Health Cards, and will likely be viewed by implementers (or patients!) without prior FHIR experience. So it's important to us from an implementer-friendliness perspective to have a URI that doesn't add friction or raise concerns.

If it's preferable to use {{[http://hl7.org/fhir/identity-assuranceLevel]}} rather than creating a new code system, is it possible to resolve the inconsistency in the name of the code system? (If not, it may be better to deprecate this code system in favor of one without the naming inconsistency, if that's possible.)

Thank you all!!
  ","2021-05-04 02:59;masnick;To my point above about implementer/patient-friendliness to meet the needs of our use case, we discussed using [http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue] for the code system above.

On further thought, this is not a good fit for our IG because 
{{{""code"": ""IAL1"", ""system"": ""}}{{[http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue]}}{{""}}} will not be understandable to anyone looking at the JSON. From a data modeling perspective, we would like the code system URI to clearly identify the content of the code.

From an implementer/patient-friendliness perspective, this URI does not promote understanding of the data and could even be alarming since the code system name implies “IAL1” is an “observation”.

We are expecting a number of implementers who do not have prior FHIR experience to be working directly with the JSON resources described by this IG. It is better for them if the meaning of {{system}} is clear from the URI since software engineers typically expect names to be meaningful, especially in URIs.

We are also expecting that some patients will decode the contents of their SMART Health Cards themselves, and would like the value of {{system}} to not cause undue concern given the high level of scrutiny projects like SMART Health Cards receive.

For these reasons, v3-ObservationValue doesn't support our primary use case. We would like to proceed with one of the other options described in my previous post.","2021-05-04 03:03;masnick;One more clarification: our initial suggestion of {{http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/loa}} is not optimal from a clarity perspective since ""loa"" could be anything. A more descriptive URI would probably be better – but keeping in mind we do have payload constraints so we would prefer to not be overly verbose :)","2021-06-23 07:22;juliemaas;Checking back in on this...did the conversation continue elsewhere or are you still awaiting further input?","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AMA's SNODENT is one of the few examples of this in HL7 Terminology.

Further, it should be noted that by their nature code systems are always changing and publishing them in full comes with the responsibility to ensure they are maintained and up to date – formal agreements will stipulate this. Accordingly, while it may be straightforward to create a FHIR CodeSystem with all the ODH content, the risks of doing so.
(a) without a formal agreement; and 
(b) as a ""one-off"" which is not maintained on an ongoing basis
Should be understand and carefully considered.

The recommendation and I other members of the HL7 Terminology Authority (HTA) have to progress this is: That HL7 HQ work with Genevieve Luensman from the CDC to obtain a formal agreement (including conditions) to support publication of a complete FHIR CodeSystem for ODH. Once this formal agreement is in place, work can be progressed to develop the CodeSystem resource in accordance with the agreement and published in HL7 Terminology (as was done for SNODENT).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

","2021-03-28 09:32;marc.duteau;...Of course. Looks like I kept the name the same as what it currently is in the IG instead of changing it like I thought I had.

The change is a correction to the name of the Value Set which should be Laboratory Result Observation Subtype. Thanks to [~Austin_Kreisler] for catching the error.","2021-04-01 03:21;RikiM;Hmm - when I follwo hte link to the published example I get to the main terminology at HL7.org page only - when I go to valuesets CDA I cannot find the valueset - I know I havevn't been as involved lately, but what am I missing?","2021-04-01 03:50;tedhl7geek;Riki, when I click on the Published Example link I get to the page for the proposal content (it looks just like a regular build).  The way to know if what you are looking at is correct is the banner on top:  

HL7 Terminology
2.1.5 - UTG Consensus Review Proposal UP-183

That second line tells you what you are looking at.   

The issue on the value set is a different question, and may represent something that was not done in the change proposal, and thus would indicate it may be incomplete.   if the value set name is changed, but the value set is not on the CDA value sets tab but should be then that would be a problem.   Perhaps Marc can clarify?

 ","2021-04-01 03:51;jsnell;Hi [~RikiM] ! It seems that the Value Set was added in the V3 tab (rather than CDA). I can't personally comment on the correctness of that, but it should help you find it. You can always look on the 'All Value Sets' tab as well.

There are a few breadcrumbs left around through the commit links that helped me decode where it was placed. We can see it was added to the v3-rendering.xml file (manifest). Addition of new resources (instead of changes to existing) can be a little trickier because we do not have that link to the existing artifact. Hope that helps!

 ","2021-04-01 04:27;RikiM;thanks to [~jsnell] I was able to find the valueset and review it - it looks good to me.

Issue is that all codes that are for systems that end up generated into the coremif need an internalID value - see the other codes for examples.  This must be unique, but the old VMIF processing we used years ago no longer exists so there is not a way to generate this value automatically so it is unique.  A rule of thumb that works is pick one of the other codes, add a zero on the end of the internalID value (multiply by 10) and that almost always works fine.

This issue is that in order for the code properties to display on the rendered output, the properties used in the CodeSystem must be declared in the header portion of the CodeSystem resource. For a good example of this, look at the v3 system ActCode, which has the definitions of all the properties intended to be shown and supported by the code system; one of the is ""status"".    If you want this to show up for NeasureType, please declare it in the resource (same style as ActCode, but of course only the one property you are setting to 'retired').

You can certainly tag some of those folks right here on this ticket to let them know you would like input. 

You also need to fulfil the 'unified' family requirement (this is in the 'Quorum Requirement Details' tab). This means that either [~cmacumber] or [~rhausam] need to vote. We reviewed this ticket on today's UTG call so Rob is aware of the ticket, and knowing this is still something you'd like will likely take some time to review and vote on it. 

We are working on making this process easier and more transparent, so hopefully next time the expectations are much clearer :)","2021-09-28 03:08;jsnell;[~oliveregger] yes, exactly. Also meeting the 15 vote minimum. You are pretty close...","2021-09-28 03:50;jsnell;[~oliveregger], slight revision. You only need the unified vote (which will close out the family requirement).","2021-10-04 04:58;oliveregger;[~rhausam] could you have a look at our code proposal which we would like to integrate and possibly vote on it? We need to have the unified family requirement satisfied, if you have any questions on the proposal do not hesitate to contact me. ","2021-10-04 10:58;rhausam;My main question is, does it make sense to add codes like this (similarly with 'at-elga') to this code system and value set in the base FHIR standard?  The code system and value set are defined as ""This value set includes *sample* Regulatory consent policy types from the US and other regions."" (emphasis mine).  I don't think that this code system and value set were actually intended to contain the policy rule codes for all jurisdictions - just *examples* of them.  It is a bit odd that Consent.policyRule has an extensible binding to this example value set, but that could be taken up with the CBCC WG.  The IG for the Swiss EPR system (presumably there is one?), though, could include this value set and then *also* include this or any other needed codes that could be defined in the IG for that use.  I think that should also be workable?  I may still vote for this, but I would like for us to consider this broader question on it first.","2021-10-04 08:25;oliveregger;[~rhausam] thank you for your comments. I did not interpret this ValueSet as a ""sample"" due to the extensible binding on Consent.policyRule. We can put the code in our swiss implementation guide, however since most of the samples are from US origin I think it might be still add value to add a few other codes from other jurisdictions. If there would be further discussion on a call can you let me know?","2021-10-04 11:07;rhausam;I'm not certain that my interpretation or suggested solution is necessarily correct, [~oliveregger].  But, as I mentioned earlier, from what is written I think it is at least plausible.  This may represent a case where something that originally began as an example then became considerably more than that (whether that should happen is a question, but at least in some cases it has).  I agree that even if we leave this code system/value set as an example, it may be very reasonable to add a few additional codes (likely including yours) from multiple jurisdictions.  Maybe we need to arrange some discussion with CBCC to better understand what their intent (past and present) for this actually is?","2021-10-05 12:28;oliveregger;Yes, I think a discussion with CBCC about their intent would be helpful. They have a call on Wednesday 01:00 PM (US Eastern Time), however the call tomorrow is cancelled. [~rhausam] Would you be able to attend one of the following calls or would it be better to try to schedule the discussion for the next wgm?","2022-01-20 11:29;david.pyke;We are moving the binding to Example for R5 but would entertain a new code.  Our regular meetings are Tuesdays at 12pm ET.  ","2022-01-21 12:33;oliveregger;Hi [~david.pyke], thank you for the response. I could join on Feb 1st or Feb 8th for the call. [~rhausam] would you also be able to join the call?","2022-01-21 09:40;david.pyke;Let me know which you'd prefer and we'll add this to the agenda.","2022-01-29 09:07;oliveregger;[~david.pyke] thanks, Feb 8th would be perfect for me.","2022-02-08 10:16;david.pyke;CBCP approves this request Oliver Egger / David Pyke : 8-0-2 on Feb 8, 2022","2022-02-08 10:26;oliveregger;[~rhausam] today CBCP approved the PR based on the ground that the binding is extensible in R4 and they accepted to have it added. For R5 it will be downgraded to an example binding but still has value to add additional jurisdictions. Would this allow you to vote for this to get to the quorum?","2022-05-31 02:30;jsnell;UTG/THO subcommittee reviewed this ticket on 5/31/22. 

[~marc.duteau] to add this branch back so that the content can be rendered for review again. ","2022-06-14 08:18;marc.duteau;The branch still exists but the content isn't rendered.  Will need to look into why.","2022-06-14 02:16;jsnell;UTG/THO subcommittee reviewed this ticket on 6/14/22. We noted that the ticket has enough votes to proceed and has also met quorum for a FHIR proposal type (even though ticket was noted as unified). There seems to a flaw in the logic that is preventing this ticket from proceeding. We will manually approve the ticket to move it along. ","2022-07-27 07:49;jsnell;[~oliveregger] , please inform me if this change is critical to get into a published release of terminology.hl7.org (THO) prior to the ballot content deadline. If not critical, it should still be published around the time of the September WGM.

UP-124 aims to change Table 0202 rather than Table 0201.  Table 0201 can remain the same if we update Table 0202. ","2021-03-10 12:58;hbuitendijk;This topic was discussed in InM on February 25 ([https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97482379)]. 

Considering the dependency of XDM on XTN.3 to be ""internet"" that would be in play in the same use case, there was agreement that UP-162, adding DSM (Direct Secure Messaging) to table 0201 used in XTN.2 would be more appropriate.

Motion: Approve the content of UP-162 to add 'DSM' to table 0201; clarify when to use internet/net in XTN.3

based on IHE usage of internet and close UP-124 since it addresses .

ActCode_ActPolicyType_ActPrivacyPolicy_InformationSensitivityPolicy

 

Description: Policy for handling information related to an identifier of an information subject, which will be afforded heightened confidentiality.
 Usage Note: Such policies may govern the sensitivity of information related to an identifier of an act, such as the identifier of a contract; a role, such as a citizen, a patient, a practitioner, or an organization; or an entity such as a medical device due to potential impact on the privacy, well-being, safety or integrity of an information subject. For example, protection against identity fraud or counterfeit.

Rationale

The initial use case for an identifier information sensitivity code arose in DaVinci discussions, which was raised by AMA HL7 members, led by Celine Lefebvre <Celine.Lefebvre@ama-assn.org>, FM cochair, is to address the vulnerability of practitioner identifiers to identity fraud.  While in the US it's true that some practitioner identifiers, such as NPI, are accessible if one queries the NPPES on particular provider individuals/organizations, that search would not yield association with specific patients/clinical records/claims, so the risk of identity theft is less than not adding ""need to know"" protections of NPI identifiers in content exchange. 

On subsequent consideration, proposers determined that there are numerous use cases for protecting identifiers, including patient citizen IDs, such as SSN, driver's license, student IDs, and health plan IDs.  In addition, there are use cases for protecting sensitive organizational identifiers, e.g., sensitive service clinics, as well as medical device IDs, e.g., those used by a VIP. 

For these reasons, we recognize the need to add an identifier information sensitivity code as a child to the ActCode_ActPolicyType_ActPrivacyPolicy_InformationSensitivityPolicy","2020-11-02 11:16;tedhl7geek;Apologies, but the infrastructure was updated a few days ago for correct coremif generation and your proposal cannot be built until you update the templates and other parts of the content in your branch with the current master in BitBucket.  Note that these changes are NOT in the content you are proposing but are part of the infrastructure; the old data from the master when you created your proposal can no longer be successfully built with the IGPubisher  Please pull and merge and resubmit.","2020-11-10 01:18;k.connor;11/10 Mohammad already rebased this, and pushed new commit to Bitbucket repo. Should be a timely way to do this - needs to be reviewed and approved by harmonization process so that we don't have to continually redo.  Also, Security members who have asked to be reviewers have not been responded to.  We will ask that someone from UTG join Security to help us progress our proposals.","2020-11-12 09:13;jsnell;[~jafarim], the three proposals you put together look great.

Just one quick note. The 'Change Objects' field is supposed to be used for the current state of the artifact that you are modifying as part of the proposal. In this case, it should be [https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/CodeSystem-v3-ActCode.html.] With that said, it is really helpful to have the Bitbucket commit link like the one you added. We are discussing how to incorporate those into the proposals as well. 

It will likely be helpful for reviewers to update the 'Change Objects' field as I indicated above for your three tickets, but feel free to leave the other link below it. Reviewers are expecting that to be the current state, so they may be confused by the commit diff. ","2020-12-03 10:46;john_moehrke;What happened to the  _EntitySensitivityPolicyType, should these not be included in the valueset ""InformationSensitivtyPolicy????  AND the reason I ask is because this new code seems more line an  _EntitySensitivityPolicyType, than an _ActInformationSensitiviityPolicy.

 

Could we make the code more readable? An acronym, that is not even spelled out as the display name, seems unfriendly.","2020-12-03 06:27;k.connor;Hi John,

Interesting questions as usual.
h1. RE Could we make the code more readable? An acronym, that is not even spelled out as the display name, seems unfriendly.

As I understand it, the code should be unique and doesn’t need to reflect the concept in any way – could be “TUNASAND” with display name “identifier information sensitivity”.

I.e., Parsimony and uniqueness are the desired result.

 *RE What happened to the  _EntitySensitivityPolicyType, should these not be included in the valueset ""InformationSensitivtyPolicy????  AND the reason I ask is because this new code seems more line an  _EntitySensitivityPolicyType, than an _ActInformationSensitiviityPolicy.*

 As far as I know, those are abstract differentiations in the code system.  They are not carried forward in value sets. 

 That said, “identifier Sensitivity” would be in  [https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/branches/UP-129-new-sensitivity-code/ValueSet-v3-ActInformationSensitivityPolicy.html] under “ActInformationSensitivityPolicy” because it’s not just sensitivity of an Entity.  E.g., a Medical Record Identifier as well as a patient/provider identifier could be a sensitive identifier.  So I think this code is in the correct place.  The ActInformationSensitivtyPolicy was meant to include sensitive information codes that include the sensitivity across the information as well as the entity.  I realize that’s clear as mud, but the differentiation is based on RIM classes, which don’t translate readily to FHIR.  See the description e.g.: ""Usage Note: Such policies may govern the sensitivity of information related to an identifier of an act, such as the identifier of a contract..""  A medical record id would be similarly sensitive as would be the patient/role and individual/entity.

 ","2021-01-11 08:00;tedhl7geek;Hi John,

Interesting questions as usual.
h1. RE Could we make the code more readable? An acronym, that is not even spelled out as the display name, seems unfriendly.

As I understand it, the code should be unique and doesn’t need to reflect the concept in any way – could be “TUNASAND” with display name “identifier information sensitivity”.

I.e., Parsimony and uniqueness are the desired result.

 *RE What happened to the  _EntitySensitivityPolicyType, should these not be included in the valueset ""InformationSensitivtyPolicy????  AND the reason I ask is because this new code seems more line an  _EntitySensitivityPolicyType, than an _ActInformationSensitiviityPolicy.*

 As far as I know, those are abstract differentiations in the code system.  They are not carried forward in value sets. 

 That said, “identifier Sensitivity” would be in  [https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/branches/UP-129-new-sensitivity-code/ValueSet-v3-ActInformationSensitivityPolicy.html] under “ActInformationSensitivityPolicy” because it’s not just sensitivity of an Entity.  E.g., a Medical Record Identifier as well as a patient/provider identifier could be a sensitive identifier.  So I think this code is in the correct place.  The ActInformationSensitivtyPolicy was meant to include sensitive information codes that include the sensitivity across the information as well as the entity.  I realize that’s clear as mud, but the differentiation is based on RIM classes, which don’t translate readily to FHIR.  See the description e.g.: ""Usage Note: Such policies may govern the sensitivity of information related to an identifier of an act, such as the identifier of a contract..""  A medical record id would be similarly sensitive as would be the patient/role and individual/entity.

That is to say, where the object being marked has already workflow based status, how is this security-policy code to be used? Having more than one way to indicate that an object is draft seems problematic. I am not against having more than one way, just that we must be clear about the potential conflicts. We should at minimum warn the implementer of these potential conflicts.  

For example when this ""security policy"" code is used on a FHIR Observation. What is the ramifications of the Observation saying .status=""final"", where the security tag indicated it is draft? What is the ramification of the Observation.status indicating draft, while the security tag does NOT?  This FHIR example is just one way this will happen in FHIR, and FHIR is not the only place where there are workflow indicators in objects.

I think this is a problematic security tag... and I am not convinced it is a ""security-policy"" code. If it must be a security tag, then it should be an ""Integrity"" code, not a ""security-policy"" code.  It seems like the need for the code is unclear, and that the recommended new code might not fit the need that is not stated.

 ","2020-12-03 06:22;k.connor;Hi John,

This is not a ""Security Policy"" in the sense of a policy used to make a decision by an ACS.  It's a security policy requirement to render a Privacy Mark code to end users.

It just happens that I put Privacy Mark codes under SecurityPolicy in the v3 hierarchy along with CUIMarks.

It is a sibling of the COPY mark you asked to be added.

It’s simply a trigger to render DRAFT for end user display.

By definition, Privacy Marks are not used in access control decisions so if someone set the observation status to final AND included DRAFTMark or COPYMark code – the access control system would operate on the observation final status despite displaying ""DRAFT"".  We can't stop Security Labelers from doing something incoherent.

See the description of the parent PrivacyMark [abstract term]

An abstract code for human readable marks indicating, e.g., the level of confidentiality protection, an authorized compartment, the integrity, or the handling instruction required by applicable policy. Such markings must be displayed as directed by applicable policy on electronically rendered information content and any electronic transmittal envelope or container; or on hardcopy information and any physical transmittal envelope or container.

Examples of protocols for marking displays on electronic or hardcopy rendered content: Across the top or ""banner"" of each page ; as a watermark placed diagonally cross each page; at the bottom or ""footer"" of each page; and may be displayed at the beginning of any portion within the content that required markings different than other portions of the content. The banner or top of page marking typically acts as a ""high watermark"" by including all of the markings made on any marked portions within the entirety of the information content.

I already tried to addressed John’s concerns  @ https://jira.hl7.org/browse/UP-128, and he hasn’t responded.  His concerns are orthogonal to the proposed COPYMark code.

 He’d previously asked me to create a DRAFTMark code, which is very similar.

 That code, as well as the proposed DRAFTMark code, are not to be construed as access control codes, and should not be used by an Access Control System to make decisions.

 Privacy Mark Descriptions/Definitions from the literature
| |Human readable security labels, which are rendered in the graphic user interface on accessed electronic information, are called “privacy marks.” The act of enabling the rendering of a privacy mark is called “privacy marking”.|
|If present, the privacy-mark is not used for access control. The content of the privacy-mark may be defined by the security policy in force (identified by the security-policy-identifier) which may define a list of values to be used. Alternately, the value may be determined by the originator of the security-label. [[ISO 22600-3|#ISO226003] Section A.3.4.3]|

 COPYMark security label tags are other Privacy Mark codes are intended to instruct an end user system what to display to end users.

 Like DRAFTMark, an implementer could mistakenly instruct an end user system to render a display that is out of synch with the actual status of the displayed information.

 For example, if I misassign a COPYmark tag in meta.security to displayed information, which has the status of created but not attested to, and which has “created” as a Provenance status, the end user could think that the status is a replication rather than an original. It may be the case that there should not be a copy available if the author hasn’t attested to it yet.

 This misalignment should not affect access control as privacy marks are not intended to be used for that purpose per definition.

I can’t resolve the issues that John raised about misapplying Privacy Marks other than to state that the Privacy Marks should align with the access control status.

We can’t prevent implementers from assigning security labels that are not in alignment with reasonable access control policies.

 John will need to address how my response doesn’t satisfy his concerns.

The current integrity label codes [http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-security-label-ds4p/branches/master/ValueSet-valueset-integrity.html]  don't include a code for DRAFT that might be used by an access control system to limit access because the labeled content is not complete.  But if it did, it would to some extent dup a status code on incomplete.  Perhaps we should add one if the access control policies require this for a use case where the content status is not sufficient.

That said, the purpose of DRAFTMark is to trigger the UI to displace this status to an end user.  As with all Privacy Marks, it is not used to control access.  Entirely different purposes, which you seem to be conflating.","2020-12-15 02:16;tedhl7geek;[~john_moehrke] are you ok with Kathleen's explanation?   I'd like to get this approved and implemented if we can - or sent back for more work if that is the decision of the security WG.","2020-12-16 05:54;john_moehrke;I am preferring that the ontology used to hold these codes was more proper.

The intent is to augment the list of classifier roles, including classifier, derivative classifier, upgrader, downgrader, with the role of a classifier authorized to change security label per policy.","2020-12-04 12:50;jafarim;I think the correct link is this: https://bitbucket.hl7.org/projects/UTG/repos/utg/commits/ea3147b579d28ee122411335cba46d4d15ce5114?to=959e4685209eca7086200c1626afd2c215b13224","2020-12-04 11:27;k.connor;Change Object = https://terminology.hl7.org/2.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-RoleCode.xml

There are similar concepts already in the CodeSystem - declassifier, downgrader, derivative classifier - as well as classifier.  As reporter, I cannot comment on whether reclassifier would be participation and not a role, however there is precedence in this code system for concepts similar to the proposed _reclassifier_.

Reclassifier, along with Classifier, Upgrader, Downgrader, Derivative Classifier, are all _AgentRoleTypes, which are privileges granted certain the actors to do certain acts.  Much like the other AgentRoleType codes, such as AMENDER, REVIEWER, VALIDATOR, these roles may never be exercised, or if exercised, might not result in executing the ACT to which the roles are associated.  A VALIDATOR might decide not to validate.  Likewise, a Reclassifier may be tasked with regularly reviewing classifications - e.g., security labels, can deciding whether the labels are still correct or need to be changed because the labeled content has changed.  I.e., these are roles and not participation by the criteria discussed above.

 ","2022-02-28 11:25;jsnell;[~seanmcilvenna], [~tedhl7geek], thank you for following up on this. I will add this agenda item to the UTG/THO subcommittee call scheduled for tomorrow. CC: [~reuben.daniels], [~LisaRNelson]","2022-03-03 08:58;LisaRNelson;We need the metadata that exists.  How are these referenced in CDA R2.0?  They are concept  domains, so the won't have an OID assigned in CDA.  Rob says he would need to look these up in Rosetree to check if they have OIDs there.  He could use those OIDS, but it may not be important to use those OIDS. It may be ok to just create OIDs for these.  For DocumentType, you may not find this.  At the CDA R2.0 level, it is a concept domain, so you would need to create a value set for this.  You should have the C-CDA LOINC Document Ontology as the minimum and an example binding.  

How will we approach this? Rob will look in Rosetree to see if there are OIDs to use those when creating these in THO.  Bind as an example value set when used since these were Concept Domain. If Rob can't find an OID, then he will make one up.
The RIM should have references for these Concept Domains - we would want to use RIM 2.07 because that is what CDA R2.0 was frozen to.  Back then, they still hadn't sorted out the distinction between Concept Domain, Code System, and Value Set.  
You may run into x_whatever things.... 
It may be difficult to determine what concepts actually belong in the value sets.
We may need to create a Code System
DocumentType is an abstract code under actCode.

Austin found some clues Normative Web addition of CDA .
Austin will help dig up more clues on this.


","2022-03-03 11:41;Austin_Kreisler;In general, the CDA R2 specification was built on RIM 2.07, where the distinction between codesystem, valueset and concept domain had not been clarified, they were all called vocabulary domains. To be able to start publishing CDA IG’s built on CDA R2 using FHIR Publishing, these will all need to be represented as value sets even though most are effectively concept domains as they became to be known in subsequent versions of the RIM. The first item, ActClassOrganizer clearly can be represented as valueset with a set of codes.
h2. http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActClassOrganizer

A valueset for ActClassOrganizer should have the following values, all drawn from ActClass, and all children of ActClassOrganizer in RIM 2.07:

ORGANIZER, CATEGORY, DOCBODY, DOCSECT, TOPIC, FOLDER

Austin’s Notes: As far as I can tell, the base CDA R2 standard does *not* use this concept domain. CDA uses the following: x_ActClassDocumentEntryOrganizer. ActClassOrganizer does appear in the voc.xsd which is one of the core xml schemas that CDA (and any V3 specification) uses. I suspect that is how it has been pulled into CDA R2, even though it’s not actually used in the specification.
h2. http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-DocumentType

In RIM 2.07, DocumentType is found in the ActCode hierarchy where it is an abstract term.

Lvl          Type, Domain name and/or Mnemonic code        Concept ID          Mnemonic           Print Name    Definition/Description

*2               A: DocumentType         V10870                The kind of document. Possible values: discharge summary, progress note, Oncology note, etc.*

Austin’s Note: This was effectively a concept domain, except that at the time, in RIM 2.07, concept domains did not exist. The “A” in “*A: DocumentType”* indicates it’s an Abstract term.
h2. http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-EncounterDischargeDisposition

From the RIM v2.07 definition of EncounterDischargeDispostion vocabulary domain:

EncounterDischargeDisposition    

A code indicating patient status as of the ending service date of the period covered on this bill, as reported in FL6, Statement Covers Period. Values such as: Discharged to home or self care; Discharged/transferred to SNF, Discharged/transferred to an intermediate care facility (ICF); Expired; Hospice-medical facility. NUBC Form Locator 22

Austin's Note: RIM 2.07 did not have any values defined for EncounterDischargeDisposition. It was effectively a concept domain.
h2. http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-DrugEntity

Austin’s Comment: DrugEntity is an abstract term in the V3 entityCode codesystem drawn from RIM 2.07. It has three additional abstract terms as specializations. This is effectively a concept domain.

2               A: DrugEntity    V16530                A substance whose therapeutic effect is produced by chemical action within the body.

3                 A: ClinicalDrug              V16205                Any substance or mixture of substances manufactured, sold or represented for use in: (a) the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease, disorder, abnormal physical state, or its symptoms, in human beings or animals; (b) restoring, correcting or modifying organic functions in human beings or animals.

4                   A: ManufacturedDrug              V16206                Identifies a drug or the use of a drug as produced by a specific manufacturer

To do that properly, I think, will require:

(1) adding the additional codes for 'preferredForLanguage' and 'consumer' (or should we use 'preferred-for-language' and 'consumer-friendly'?) to the current [designation-usage|http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/CodeSystem-designation-usage.html] code system in UTG

(2) updating the UTG [designation-usage|http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/ValueSet-designation-usage.html] value set to include the 2 SNOMED CT codes

that are the contents currently of the [designation-use|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html] value set in the core FHIR spec

(3) update the bindings in the FHIR core spec in [CodeSystem.concept.designation.use|http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-definitions.html#CodeSystem.concept.designation.use] and [ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation.use|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation.use] to refer to the UTG [designation-usage|http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/ValueSet-designation-usage.html] value set (instead of the FHIR core [designation-use|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html] value set) (note that both resources are normative)

Seems we've twisted something simple into quite a knot. We discussed this at connectathon I believe. While I can not find any notes for the breakout on Designations, I seem to remember that there were a number of folks that shared @Grahame Grieve concern that [DesignationUse|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html] was specific to SNOMED CT code system use _exclusively_ and that we need more designation ""types"" in what we should be using everywhere: [DesignationUsage|http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/ValueSet-designation-usage.html]. There does seem to be two UTG JIRA issues: 102 and 107 but lets follow @Rob Hausam advice and comment on 107. 

So I think we need to determine if we can remove the [DesignationUse|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html] value set, and if not, then make it only apply to SCT. I think we need to add additional concepts to Code System [DesignationUsage|[http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/CodeSystem-designation-usage.html]] but at least display, synonym, and any others requested.","2020-09-28 04:38;GrahameGrieve;I think we should:

* keep the value set
* document that the snomed codes are appropriate only for snomed ct concepts
* add our own additional codes in our code system
* add ""preferred for language"" and ""consumer"" to the UTG code system
* improve the definition of display in the existing code (What is it not?)","2020-11-02 08:06;rhausam;So, for ""keep the value set"", there are 2 options that I see:
 * Keep the [designation-use|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html] value set definition as it is:
 ** In this case the 2 SNOMED CT codes for ""Synonym"" and ""Fully specified name"" will remain as the only content in the value set.
 ** The only change to the FHIR specification is to clarify that the SNOMED CT codes are only expected to be used *with* SNOMED CT, and not with other code systems (although presumably it would not be *prohibited* to use them with other code systems).
 ** Even though it's only a change in the text, I think that change would be ""*Compatible, substantive*"" because, with the extensible binding, where previously many (if not most or all of us) have interpreted the SNOMED CT code as the only option available for expressing the meaning of ""synonym"", now it will be possible to use any code (including local or non-SNOMED codes) to represent the meaning of ""synonym"", at least if the code system that is being used is *not* SNOMED CT. 
 ** We would add the `preferred for language` and `consumer` codes to ""our code system"" (i.e. [designation-usage|http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/CodeSystem-designation-usage.html] in UTG) so they would be available for use in [CodeSystem.concept.designation.use|http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-definitions.html#CodeSystem.concept.designation.use] and 
[ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation.use|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation.use].  
*But*, this would mean that beyond ""Synonym"" and ""Fully specified name"" for use with SNOMED CT, we would be providing *no guidance* for what other codes might be used in the 'designation.use' elements - *any* code (standard or local or otherwise) could be used to specify the designation use and the instance would be conformant.

 *  Update the [designation-use|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html] value set definition:
 ** In this case the value set definition would be updated to also include the codes in [designation-usage|http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/CodeSystem-designation-usage.html].  So this would include the codes that are in that code system now (i.e. only `display`) and any others that we add in the future (e.g., `preferred for language`, `consumer`, etc.).
 ** With the extensible binding, I believe this would be a ""*Non-compatible*"" change.  For example, someone may have been using a designation use code from their own code system to indicate a ""consumer friendly"" term, which was a conformant use.  But now they would find that, with the extensible binding, the code that they had previously been using is, in fact, no longer conformant (if someone bothered to check it).
 ** A couple of side effects (which may not be at all significant) of this are that there would be no use (as far as I'm aware) for the UTG [designation-usage|http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/ValueSet-designation-usage.html] value set.  Plus the [designation-use|http://build.fhir.org/valueset-designation-use.html] value set that is defined in the FHIR core spec, which is the one that we are using, is based in part on codes that are being defined in UTG (not in the FHIR spec itself or an external code system).","2020-09-29 04:21;mjlawley;Documenting that the SNOMED codes are only for SNOMED seems pretty revisionist.  Also, with respect to at least 900000000000013009 (Synonym), somewhat hairsplitting and change for change's sake.

What is the difference between ""preferred for language"" and ""display""?

What  does ""consumer"" mean?

Whatever changes are made to the set, it needs to be clear which values (e.g., ""display"" in conjunction with language) have an impact on terminology server behaviour, and which are merely for ""pass-through"".

 ","2020-09-29 04:39;mjlawley;SNOMED ""Language"" reference sets ([https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/x/L4e2AQ)] are about specifying a notion of Acceptability which can vary depending on context (the specific reference set implicitly indicates the context).

The three designation (description) aspects that SNOMED distinguishes are:
 * The designation type (FSN, synonym, or textual definition)
 * The designation use context (language dialects, domain specific use contexts such as consumer-friendly, nursing, medical specialty specific terms, etc.)
 * The role of the designation in that context, for SNOMED whether the designation is preferred or acceptable in that use context (i.e. acceptability). ""preferredForLanguage"" seems to fall in this category.

Other code systems make use of at least some of these aspects; LOINC has fully specified, short, long common, and consumer names, ICD-10 has different kinds of rubric etc. 

As you all know there is only one designation.use element to cover these three aspects, and a SNOMED CT subset for designation type, debatably the least useful use aspect, was chosen. The work done by the SNOMED on FHIR group (documented [here|https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/FHIR/Mechanisms+for+working+with+Languages]) has led to a proposal for an extension [here|https://github.com/IHTSDO/snomed-ig/blob/duc/fsh/fsh-source/DesignationUseContextExtension.fsh] for discussion.

However, if there is an opportunity to change the current binding to allow designation.use to represent the designation use context instead of designation type and hence replace the value set with a set of designation use contexts for commonly used code systems, that would be the preferred option.","2020-11-05 02:52;Rob_McClure;Goodness we can make things complicated. I think we need to consider making the cardinality of xx.concept.designation.use 0..* and then allow something to identified with ""types, use context, and role.""

Challenge accepted: the multiple real examples are in the text above: SYN and FSN (already in the value set), ""preferredForLanguage"" and ""consumer-friendly"" could well appear at the same time.

 ","2020-11-24 02:49;tedhl7geek;the final state of the content of the value set needs to be the two existing SNOMED CT codes, plus the addition of the two code values [http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/hl7TermMaintInfra#preferredForLanguage] and [http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/hl7TermMaintInfra#consumer|http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/hl7TermMaintInfra#preferredForLanguage]

as the cardinality is 0..1 and binding is extensible, having all codes in the same valueset would prohibit any possibility of having a consumer preferred synonym.

Anything else that needs to be done?","2020-12-01 02:05;mjlawley;Hi [~tedhl7geek],

During discussion on today's SNOMED on FHIR call we dug into the {{display}} vs {{preferredForLanguage}} topic.

It seems that sometime after the 1st ballot for R4 ([http://hl7.org/fhir/2018May/languages.html##term]) the CodeSystem defining display was erroneously moved from [http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/designation-usage] to [http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/designation-usage] .

I say erroneously because the semantics of {{display}} are intrinsic to the behaviour of FHIR Terminology Services (ie selection of preferred term for a given language, e.g., in the presence of the display-language parameter to ValueSet/$expand) and thus should live in the core FHIR Spec.  However, I suspect it's not a particularly useful thing to re-re-name this CodeSystem just for the sake of purity so I would suggest we're stuck with the current URI even though it should be ""owned"" by the FHIR spec itself.

Now, unless the intent is for {{preferredForLanguage}} to be a purely client-side indicator, it would seem to duplicate (and post-date) the semantics of {{display}} and thus it should be dropped in preference to {{display}}.

I would also argue that making it a client-side indicator is against the spirit of FHIR Terminology Services which is to offload work to the server and make the client's life simpler.

 ","2020-12-03 02:50;GrahameGrieve;it wasn't moved erroneously - it was moved correctly. But moving it shouldn't be taken to mean that servers aren't expected to care about it - of course they must. that's why the value set is extensible - it's reasonable for servers to know the codes in the value set itself. 

{{preferredForLanguage}} doesn't a duplication of 'display'. it's full name might be '{{preferredDisplayForLanguage}} ' - it is a display, yes, but it's additionally preferred for the language (though the meaning of that is most definitely slippery)

 ","2020-12-03 02:51;carmela_couderc;Discussed on the 12/3/2020 FHIR Tracker call.

Discussion: preferredForLanguage and display do not have the same meaning; both should be in the value set. 

The SNOMED on FHIR work on designation use extension should continue (to capture qualifications on designation use - acceptability), and be considered for a standard extension to make it available for general use. Defining as a standard extension would be beneficial for clients. 

Peter Jordan suggests that a decision tree be created to help determine whether an extension is required. 

This ticket can move ahead independent of the SNOMED on FHIR decision.

 

 ","2020-12-03 08:44;mjlawley;But the designation comes with a language.  So, how are the following two designations for the same concept saying different things?

in trying to guide our Swedish FHIR users we would like some more clarity on the difference between ""display"" and ""preferredForLanguage"". Further, as the representation of SNOMED CT output (e.g. expansion) likely will require an extension, guidance on the priority between existing codes (SYN+FSN), ""consumer"", ""display"", and ""preferredForLanguage"" is needed when multiple codes can be used. E.g. how should designation.use be coded for a preferred, consumer, synonym used as display? Are multiple designations required?

We've put in the request with [~j_harper] who will be putting together the proposal. Cheers!","2022-01-31 10:16;j_harper;I have made the changes to the codesystem cs-v2-0203 (_HL7v2 Table 0203 Identifier Type_) to add an identifier for JPID.  

Please review the changes.","2022-02-02 12:31;lloyd;The definition for the new code is poor.  What does it mean?  How is it different from a JHN?  Do JPIDs span patient and practitioner roles?","2022-02-02 01:14;jduteau;Can you provide examples of a Canadian JPID?  The description “Federal Identifier that can be used along with Jurisdictional Health Number” isn’t clear enough for me.  Is this a Passport number?  A Driver’s License number? A treaty number?  All of those already have codes.  As well, I’m confused by the use of the term “Federal” since that applies a specific jurisdiction that might be Canadian-specific.","2022-02-02 02:53;sheridancook;[~lloyd] [~jduteau] This request follows the [analysis work|https://infocentral.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/forum/266-fhir-implementations/2171-call-to-review-namingsystem-profile] that was completed previously to type the identifiers used in the Canadian NamingSystem Registry. A need arose to distinguish identifiers in use in Canadian systems from the JHN that is defined as a provincial health card number. Use of this type is intended to span identifiers that are issued under federal jurisdictions as well as provincial jurisdictions to a person it is not intended to be isolated to identifiers issued for healthcare delivery purposes but it's important to note that this type of identifier may be used within those workflows. 

The following are examples that fell under the proposed type of JPID from the efforts of the Canadian URI Registry: [Canada, Social Insurance Number;|https://simplifier.net/canadianuriregistry/ca-social-insurance-number] [Interim Federal Health Program Identifier, |https://simplifier.net/canadianuriregistry/ca-interim-federal-health-id] [Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada number|https://simplifier.net/canadianuriregistry/ca-indigenous-northern-affairs-number]

In the last year - this type has been requested and used by implementers looking to type identifiers that are assigned by provincial jurisdictional assets (e.g., myHealthNB) that are distinct from the health card number that person might have within the jurisdiction, but may be similarly needed to retrieve data for the person using that identifier. 

Rather than have profilers and implementers using this type either provide no code system or a local system to get around errors from trying to claim this type - we're requesting it's inclusion in the v2-0203 code system.","2022-02-02 02:49;jduteau;But there are already Identifier type codes for those.  We already have PN - Person Number, TN - Treaty Number, etc.  I'm still confused over how this differs from those.","2022-02-02 03:26;sheridancook;Many of the types in the code system could fall under the definition of Person Number (""A number that is unique to a living subject within an Assigning Authority."") - The presence of over 70+ codes in the existing code systems shows precedence that granularity matters for identifier type.  

For our implementers in Canada - this type has been used to further differentiate identifiers in the registry for 3+ years, and more recently is starting to be used by jurisdictions working with legacy systems that want to maintain that differentiation (between business identifiers, health card #s, and identifiers that have been issued by federal and provincial programs) when they begin to model their data in FHIR. The desire to obtain this separate type is also felt by FHIR profilers wanting to apply expectations for how/when certain identifier types are used - slices differentiating between JHN, JPID, etc. are in use by the Canadian base specification, provincial base specifications, and other regional and use case driven specs in Canada.

 ","2022-02-02 03:47;jduteau;I still don't understand the need for this code.  You say that you want more granularity than existing codes but this is not a very granular code given the types of identifiers that would fall under this.

For future implementers who wanted to specify the type of identifier for an Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada number, how would they possibly know that JPID vs TN vs PN?

It just seems to me that existing codes would satisfy the requirement, especially since Identifier types are intended to be general categories and the identifier system tells you exactly what the identifier is for.","2022-02-02 04:48;lloyd;There's already an identifier type that covers ""Social Beneficiary Numbers"" - of which U.S. SSN and Canadian SIN are examples.  We don't want types that overlap if we can possibly avoid it.  So if we're adding something new, it would need to explicitly exclude SBNs.  In any case, if this is going to be allowed for use with FHIR, the definition needs to make clear what's in, what's out and ensure it doesn't overlap with the existing identifier types.","2022-02-15 11:57;j_harper;We have discussed this issue in the HL7 Canada Community and will be withdrawing this request.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

 # (Required) The version value must be incremented for all artifacts. Change in URI is major (i.e. 2.0.0 to 3.0.0)  but since this is under HTA's oversight, I think [~cmacumber] or someone else should confirm. This is more my fault that you didn't know because we updated your versions in the past (we didn't notice they were incorrect initially). We should have informed you. 
 # I suggest updating the date value to the edited or approved date.
 # For the Naming Systems, it is helpful to add effective dates for the URIs, I have an example here (see in rendering and XML): [https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/UTG/branches/UP-96-fix-dicom-to-be-correct-per-hta/NamingSystem-v3-DCM.html]
 # I like Carol's suggestions above for the name changes.","2020-09-23 02:10;Rob_McClure;[~jfrancis] Agree with the comments noted above. I am also concerned about the chosen final Canonical URLs. You have chosen to use the url that currently identifies the CCI code system to now (and forever) identify ICD-10-CA. I understand that url does indeed have the ICD-10-CA phrase in it but I would assume that the confusion by reusing an identifier actually makes things worse. Why not use a completely new url as you are doing for the new CCI code system identifier?","2020-09-24 06:29;jfrancis;Thank you [~jsnell] and [~cmacumber] for the detailed explanation on the changes required. Much appreciated. I have made the proposed changes :)

Just want to confirm with [~tedhl7geek] that changing the ""name"" element field in the CodeSystem stub addresses the lower case/upper case naming issues. i.e, Cci to CCI? Is there any other place I need to make the changes?","2020-09-24 06:26;jfrancis;[~Rob_McClure] thank you for the comment and feedback. The issue of the CCI CodeSystem pointing to ICD-10-CA is a mistake prior to my submission of proposal(pre implementation). 

Once this proposal is implemented CCI uri : [http://cihi.ca/fhir/CodeSystem/cihi-cci] instead of [http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-ca.|http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-ca]

I wasn't sure how this error with the meta data was made in the first place. Does this help?

 

 ","2020-09-24 09:33;jfrancis;[~tedhl7geek] changes made and committed. I had some difficulty for  SourceTree picking up a change and removing  blank space helped me.  I replaced end date with an empty string. Hopefully that doesn't break the build.","2020-09-24 10:46;Rob_McClure;That explains the provenance of the current state, but does not address my concern with respect to the fact that the mistake is in current production use. I'm suggesting you *do not reuse and change the meaning of* the existing canonical url. And honestly I'm not sure _why_ you would want to use that one anyway.","2020-09-25 01:06;tedhl7geek;It is my understanding that we need to approach changing any canonical URLs that are rooted in hl7.org/fhir with extreme caution (unlike those generated by the v3 coremif import into UTG rooted in terminology.hl7.org) as we don't know how many production systems they may be currently used in.   I do not know how best to figure this out; perhaps [~lloyd] can offer some insight here.","2020-09-25 01:55;lloyd;Agree.  As a rule, cannonical URLs should *never* change once they're established.  We can add a link to the current authoritative source in the NamingSystem, but changing canonical URLs breaks interoperability","2020-09-28 08:58;jfrancis;[~tedhl7geek] [~lloyd]n [~Rob_McClure]

What I don't understand is that this URL was perhaps made up at a connectathon and systems ought to be using the OID instead until the authoritative source in question publishes a valid URI. This URI points to a whole different CodeSystem than what was actually intended.  

So what I am hearing is do not change the URI but perhaps in the description of the NamingSystem resource mention the correct URI as the authoritative source?

cc: [~amaclean]

 ","2020-09-28 09:18;lloyd;Someone submitted a formal request to register the URL.  Now that it's registered, it is significantly problematic to change it - unless you're confident that no existing implementations are using it (which is unlikely given that the URL got registered a while ago).  If there's a registered URL, then you can't use an OID to identify the code system in FHIR - and our general objective is to use URLs in place of OIDs wherever possible because OIDs are much harder to work with for implementers and the cost of managing the conversion (using NamingSystem) is less than the long-term cost of continuing to use OIDs.  We can absolutely update the NamingSystem to point to the current authoritative URL for source-of-truth.  (Those URLs change semi-often.)","2020-09-28 12:41;Rob_McClure;[~lloyd] honestly, this is starting to border on the absurd. The url that I asked [~jfrancis] about was for CCI and ends in icd-10-ca. So we are clear, are you saying that the canonical url for CCI *MUST* be the url that ends in icd-10-ca because it was that before and then we'll have a different one that also ends in icd-10-ca for the actual icd-10-ca? Let's not talk in theoretical absolutes. Lloyd, please indicate what you are advocating for explicitly. ","2020-09-28 02:09;lloyd;Ok, so I think the first question here is: where did these URLs come from and where have they previously been published?

""http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-ca"" *looks* like something that was registered with FHIR, but I can't see any reference to it in the FHIR core spec.  It's also not something the FHIR server currently recognizes, which suggests it was never registered.  On the other hand, I see no indication that ""http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/icd10-CA"" was ever previously published in the FHIR spec before UTG got stood up.  In order to know which URL should survive, we need to understand what's been published where & when and, most importantly, what's most likely in use in real systems.  Whatever we choose as 'official' should be the one most likely to be in use (and should act expediently to remove all references saying anything else, except as something deprecated.

In terms of [http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-ca] showing up as a URL for CCI, we need to understand where that came from too.  If it was just an error in standing up UTG, then fixing it is a simple technical correction.  It seems unlikely that any implementer would ever have used this as a URL for CCI, so the risk to fixing it is small.","2020-09-28 03:31;tedhl7geek;I can unequivocally state that the URL ""http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/icd10-CA"" was algorithmically created by the coremif import into UTG, and was not published anywhere prior to the 1.0.0 release in April 2020.   The only reason this should IMHO stay in the NamingSystem track for it as an old and non-preferred identifier is we simply do not know if anyone picked it up from the HL7 Terminology release in the past five months and used it - but the likelihood is low.","2020-09-29 06:48;jfrancis;After many discussions with [~tedhl7geek], I understood the format ""http://terminology/something"" to be a placeholder until a valid URI existed and the metadata was changed explicitly to reflect the change. 

The current CCI description which is also not entirely accurate was taken from the description in the HL7 OID registry from 2009. If the URL was stood up in error, can we proceed with the current proposal to implement the change in the URI and description?

 

 

 ","2020-09-30 11:46;jfrancis;[~tedhl7geek]  [~Rob_McClure] [~lloyd] We have raised the issue of the URL in production on the various Canadian forums and have received no comments thus far.  Therefore it is our intention to make the changes as per the proposal and not perpetuate the mistake how/when ever it may have occurred. 

Would you please kindly consider voting in favour of this change.

 

cc [~amaclean] [~Rongparker] [~j_harper] [~jsnell] [~cmacumber]","2020-09-30 11:55;jsnell;[~jfrancis], one more fix request. On the effective date period you added for the Naming Systems, I think the end date should be removed.

Code system https://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-data-absent-reason.html could have been used for asked-unknown and not-asked. Decided to use 2.16.840.1.113883.18.347 https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-v2-0532.html.{noformat}
It seems like a more detailed explanation of the rationale for the decision would be helpful here. If the data-absent-reason codes could have been used, what was the reason that the codes from V2 table 0532 were chosen instead?","2020-08-12 03:12;carmela_couderc;Thanks for your question [~rhausam].

Rather than create the value set drawn from two code systems, I decided to use one that contains all the necessary concepts. Another issue is that the definition of not-asked in the FHIR DataAbsentReason code system is ""the workflow didn't lead to this value being known"". That seemed odd and doesn't fit the use case/reason the DRLS project created this value set.

In the Review of Systems, as a clinician is moving through the _systems_ on a form/questionnaire_,_ the workflow might absolutely lead to the potential for the question to be asked, but the clinician decided not to ask it - possibly because the system in question (e.g. gastrointestinal) is not critical to evaluate for the encounter (e.g. evaluation for non-emergency ambulance transport).  

That is why I selected the V2 code system.

 ","2020-10-15 02:29;carmela_couderc;[~ahenket]  or [~sylvia_thun] or [~Rongparker] would one or both of you please vote on this proposal? Thanks. ","2020-10-29 10:23;ahenket;Yes/No/ASKU/NASK is a pretty common pattern. However, plain UNK (unknown) is even more common. UNK is a tad less specific than ASKU/NASK would be. You basically would not know if it had been asked or not in that case.

Both the [NullFlavor extension|http://build.fhir.org/extension-iso21090-nullflavor.html] and the [data-absent-reason extension|http://build.fhir.org/extension-data-absent-reason.html] both cover the ""unknown"" part of the value set. Why reinvent that part in a different code system? Could the value set not combine codes from 2 code systems? Asking a person something is (albeit minimal) some form of workflow so I do not see its definition as a valid point towards dismissing applicability.

DECISION: Motion:

Ted motions that the concept codes defined by pattern in tables 0203 and 0396 and any other V2 code systems containing pattern-based concept codes be corrected by:
 * Identify all of the pattern-based codes in V2 code systems, then determine which will be enumerated directly in the existing code system and which will not be so enumerated - Ted will lead
 * For those that should not be enumerated directly within the existing code system, those will be enumerated in a new code system(s) using good vocabulary practices
 * All pattern-based concept codes should be made inactive and appropriately documented in the comments and notes reasons for inactivating the pattern-based concept codes
 * Modify or create the appropriate value sets that inform the table content that must include the pattern-based and now enumerated codes and adjust the links to the table code linkage accordingly in the V2 Tables code system

 # Published Example: this links the the UTG Home Page for my branch. It is not automated enough just yet to direct you to the resource as we are still designing it (simply because we need to address the case where multiple objects are edited in one branch). The Change Objects field is actually quite helpful because it will give you the object name and type, so once you click on the Published example link you know to click on the Code System tab and search for UTG Concept Properties (Note that the Title does differ from the file name so it still has some quirks - we have created [https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/Cross+Reference+of+Resource+Elements+and+Filenames] to help locate objects based on Name, Title, or URL).

Question for V2MG:  Does the CWE have to have a qualifier? If so, this may not be correct.

1) The 0560 - Coded Content. Need to remove the values that are being displayed.
2) remove the table reference from  Chapter 16 PSL-12 Product/Service Quantity
3) Chapter 16, 16.4.6.8 ADJ-6 Adjustment Quantity
a) remove the table value displayed in the lsit
b) Remove the paragraph:
X12 REF: table 673 Quantity Qualifier. New values from X12 673 can be added as required. Refer to User-defined Table 0560 - Quantity Units in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. 

[~craig.newman], Any suggestions for how we go forward?
THX....




","2022-08-12 07:54;craig.newman;[~mkmcdaniel] 

v2MG is fine with removing the example values from table 560 is that is what FM wants

For a data type like CQ where the CWE is a Component, the binding to the table of coded values must be in the field, and not in the data type because the binding may be different for different fields using CQ. So for PSL-12 and ADJ-6, it is appropriate to keep the table 560 list in the segment definition. If you think that these two fields should be using different units of measure, then there should be multiple tables (but given that for at least 560, there are no suggested having separate tables may not provide any additional value over just using 560 for both fields)

 ","2022-08-22 11:57;FrankOemig;Are we then reduce table 0560 to concept domain only!?","2022-08-22 01:00;mfaughn;That would make sense. 

Note that removing the suggested values also requires editing the segment field definitions that reference table 560's suggested values.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
