Constraints: The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum
potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is
specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding
systems. The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as
LOINC for observations, etc.
Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the
Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be
reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then
individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated
under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.
Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the
Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a
negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code ""potassium""
together with and Act.classCode for ""laboratory observation"" to somehow
mean ""potassium laboratory observation"" and then use the same Act.code
for ""potassium"" together with Act.classCode for ""medication"" to mean
""substitution of potassium"". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and

Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a
policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and
vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information
category because of differing organizational business rules, security
policies, and jurisdictional requirements. For example, an ""employee""
sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy
domain. ""Taboo"" would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless
there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose
sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be
more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify
those who access a patient's orders and observations about the
sensitivity policies that apply. Newer systems may have a security
engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The
