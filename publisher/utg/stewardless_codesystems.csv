v3,ActCode,http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode,"A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.

*Constraints:* The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems. The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.

Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.

Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code ""potassium"" together with and Act.classCode for ""laboratory observation"" to somehow mean ""potassium laboratory observation"" and then use the same Act.code for ""potassium"" together with Act.classCode for ""medication"" to mean ""substitution of potassium"".

This code system is partitioned into three sections: Affiliate realms, Binding realms and Namespace realms. All affiliate realm codes may automatically be used as both binding realms and namespace realms. Furthermore, affiliate realms are the only realms that have authority over the creation of binding realms. (Note that 'affiliate' includes the idea of both international affiliates and the HL7 International organization.) All other codes must be associated with an owning affiliate realm and must appear as a specialization of \_BindingRealm or \_NamespaceRealm. For affiliates whose concepts align with nations, the country codes from ISO 3166-1 2-character alpha are used for the code when possible so these codes should not be used for other realm types. It is recommended that binding realm and namespace codes submitted by affiliates use the realm code as a prefix to avoid possible collisions with ISO codes. However, tooling does not currently support namepace realm codes greater than 2 characters.

*Open Issue:* The name of the concept property ""owningAffiliate"" should be changed to better reflect that the property value is the human readable name of the organizational entity that manages the Realm identified by the Realm Code.

*Open Issue:* In spite of the inability of tooling to process codes longer than 2 characters, there is at least one realm codes ('SOA') that was added that is 3 characters in length."

When this code is NULL, it indicates that the translation is an undefined type. When valued, this property must contain one of the following values:

SRC - Source (or original) code HL7 - HL7 Specified or Mandated SH - both HL7 mandated and the original code (precoordination)

The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role. Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.

The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:

 *  **RoleClassOntological** is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.
 *  **RoleClassPartitive** collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a ""part"" of the scoping entity.
 *  **RoleClassAssociative** collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:
    
     *  **RoleClassPassive** which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.
     *  **RoleClassMutualRelationship** which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be *de facto* behavior. Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:
        
         *  **RoleClassRelationshipFormal** in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.
         *  **Personal relationship** which inks two people in a personal relationship.

The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the ""Personal relationship"" which is a leaf concept.
