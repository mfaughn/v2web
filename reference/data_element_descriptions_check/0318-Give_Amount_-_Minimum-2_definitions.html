<h2>Data Element #318 - Give Amount - Minimum</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4A RXE.3 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the ordered amount as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment supplier.  In a variable dose order, this is the minimum ordered amount.  In a non-varying dose order, this is the exact amount of the order.</p><p class="v2 v2_note">Note:This field is not a duplication of the first component of the quantity/timing field, since in non-pharmacy/treatment orders, that component can be used to specify multiples of an ordered amount. <br/><br/>Another way to say this is that, for pharmacy/treatment orders, the quantity component of the quantity/timing field refers to what is to be given out at each service interval; thus, in terms of the RX order, that first component always defaults to 1.  Hence, in the actual execution of the order, the value of 1 in the first component of the quantity/timing field always refers to one administration of the amount specified in this field (the requested Give Amount field).</p><br/><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 4A RXG.5 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the ordered amount as encoded by the pharmacy/treatment supplier.
