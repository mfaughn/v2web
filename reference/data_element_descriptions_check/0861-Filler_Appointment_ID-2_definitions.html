<h2>Data Element #861 - Filler Appointment ID</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 10 ARQ.2 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the filler application&#39;s permanent identifier for the appointment request (and the scheduled appointment itself, when confirmed as a booked slot by the filler application).  This is a composite field. The first component is a string that identifies an individual appointment request, or booked appointment.  It is assigned by the filler application, and it identifies an appointment request and the subsequent scheduled appointment, uniquely among all such requests and/or booked appointments from a particular processing application.  If the filler appointment ID identifies a parent of a repeating schedule request, then the individual scheduled child appointments can be uniquely identified either by a new filler appointment ID or the parent&#39;s filler appointment ID plus an occurrence number, specified in <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENARQ-3-Occurrence number">ARQ-3-Occurrence number</a>.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">The second through fourth components contain the assigning authority identifying information. This is a conditionally required field.  On initial request messages and other messages where a filler has not yet assigned a filler appointment ID, this field should not contain a value.  In all other subsequent messages, where a filler application has assigned a filler appointment ID and communicated it to other applications, this field is required.</p><br/><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 10 SCH.2 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the filler application&#39;s permanent identifier for the appointment request (and the scheduled appointment itself, when it has been confirmed as a booked slot by the filler application).
