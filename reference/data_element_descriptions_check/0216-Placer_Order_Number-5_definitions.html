<h2>Data Element #216 - Placer Order Number</h2><h3>5 distinct definitions</h3><br/>

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment).  It is assigned by the placer (ordering application).  It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application.  The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, &quot;HD &ndash; Hierarchic designator&quot;).  The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application.  A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required.  A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs.  The components are separated by component delimiters.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">There are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique): </p><ol class="v2 v2-list v2-lower-alpha-list-normallistalpha" style="list-style: lower-alpha">
