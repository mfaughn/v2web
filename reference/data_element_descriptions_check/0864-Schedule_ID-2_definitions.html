<h2>Data Element #864 - Schedule ID</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 10 ARQ.5 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field contains an identifier code for the schedule in which this appointment should be (or is) booked.  This field is provided for situations in which filler applications maintain multiple schedules, and in which a particular resource or set of resources is controlled by more than one of those schedules.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">If a new appointment must be booked, it may be necessary to provide a schedule ID to uniquely identify the intended slot(s) being requested in the transaction.  After the request has been assigned to one or more slots; however, the filler application should assign a unique filler appointment ID (see sections <a href="BROKEN10.6.1.1">10.6.1.1</a>, &quot;<a href="BROKENARQ-1   Placer Appointment ID">ARQ-1   Placer Appointment ID   (EI)   00860</a>,&quot; and <a href="BROKEN10.6.1.2">10.6.1.2</a>, &quot;<a href="BROKENARQ-2   Filler Appointment ID">ARQ-2   Filler Appointment ID   (EI)   00861</a>).&quot;  This filler appointment ID, as its definition indicates, should uniquely identify the appointment among all such requests and appointments within the filler application.  This means that, once assigned, the filler appointment ID should uniquely identify the appointment (either as a request or as a booked appointment) without a need to provide the schedule ID too.  As a cautionary note regarding implementation, if the filler appointment ID would not otherwise be unique, it may be necessary to include the schedule ID as part of the filler appointment ID.  This can be done either by prefixing the appointment ID with the schedule ID, or by appending the schedule ID to the appointment ID.</p><br/><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 10 SCH.5 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field contains an identifier code for the schedule in which this appointment is (or will be) booked.  This field is provided for instances in which filler applications maintain multiple schedules, and when a particular resource or set of resources is controlled by more than one of those schedules.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">This field is provided on the SCH segment for informational purposes to applications fulfilling the placer, querying and auxiliary roles.</p>
