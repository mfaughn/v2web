<h2>Data Element #696 - Query Tag</h2><h3>3 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 5 QAK.1 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field may be valued by the initiating system to identify the query, and may be used to match response messages to the originating query.  If it is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgment segment (QAK).  This field differs from <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENMSA-2-message control ID">MSA-2-message control ID</a> in that its value remains constant for each message (i.e., all continuation messages) associated with the query, whereas <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENMSA-2-Message control ID">MSA-2-Message control ID</a> may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole. <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENQAK-1-Query tag">QAK-1-Query tag</a> is not conditional on the presence of the <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENQRD-1-Query ID">QRD-1-Query ID</a> field in the original mode queries; in the original mode queries <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENQAK-1-Query tag">QAK-1-Query tag</a> is not used.</p><br/><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 5 QID.1 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field identifies the instance of a query.</p><br/><h4>          ---------- 3rd Description: Ch. 5 QPD.2 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field may be valued by the initiating system to identify the query, and may be used to match response messages to the originating query.
