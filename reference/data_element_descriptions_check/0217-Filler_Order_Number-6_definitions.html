<h2>Data Element #217 - Filler Order Number</h2><h3>6 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 4 ORC.3 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field is the order number associated with the filling application.  It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (Section 2.A.28).  Its first component is a string that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment).  It is assigned by the order filler (receiving) application.  This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory).  This uniqueness must persist over time.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see Section 2.A.36, &quot;HD &ndash; hierarchic designator&quot;). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network.  A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required.  The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID.  The application ID list becomes one of the institution&#39;s master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8.  Since third- party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the filler application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues.  The data in <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENORC-2">ORC-2</a> and <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENOBR-2">OBR-2</a> are logically the same thing: a placer id.  The data in <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENORC-3">ORC-3</a> and <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENOBR-3">OBR-3</a> are logically the same thing: the filler id.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">From that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a &quot;Send Number&quot; control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENORC-2">ORC-2</a> and <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENOBR-2">OBR-2</a> are valued, then they must be valued the same; as well, if both <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENORC-3">ORC-3</a> and <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENOBR-3">OBR-3</a> are valued, then they must be valued the same.  The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">The <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENfiller order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3)">filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3)</a> also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations.  For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations.  In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.  </p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with <a href="REFERENCE_ATTRIBUTEBROKENORC-1-order control">ORC-1-order control</a> equal to &quot;CA&quot; and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.</p><br/><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 4 OBR.3 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition: This field is the order number associated with the filling application.

This uniqueness must persist over time.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, &quot;HD &ndash; hierarchic designator&quot;).

If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair.  The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. </p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations.

Where a transcription service or similar organization creates the document and uses an internally unique identifier, that number should be inserted in this field.  Its first component is a string of characters that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., OBR).  This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (i.e., transcription service).  This uniqueness must persist over time.  Where a number is reused over time, a date can be affixed to the non-unique number to make it unique.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">The second through fourth components contains the (filler) assigning authority.  The (filler) assigning authority is a string of characters that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network.  The second through fourth components of the filler order number always identify the actual filler of an order.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">TXA-15 - Condition: If corresponding ORC and/or OBR segments are present in the message and ORC-3 or OBR-3 is valued, this field must be blank.
