<h2>Data Element #2182 - Mood Code</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 7 OBX.22 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition: This field identifies the actuality of the observation (e.g., intent, request, promise, event).    Refer to <a href="HL70725">HL7 Table 0725 &ndash; Mood Codes</a> for valid values.   This field may only be used with new trigger events and new messages from v 2.6 onward.   When this field is not valued in a message that qualifies, then the Value is assumed to be &#39;EVN&#39;.</p><p class="v2 v2_note">Note:  OBX-22 Mood Code was introduced in v 2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs.  At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context messages as described in this chapter.  This statement does not preclude the use of OBX-22, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until appropriate use cases are established.  While a similar note exists for OBX-21 Observation Instance Identifier, particular care should be taken with OBX-22 as this could modify the intent of the segment/message and create backward compatibility problems.</p><br/><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 12 GOL.22 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field indicates the Mood of the Goal.  It allows expression of the context of the problem.  </p><p class="v2 v2_note">Note: As Mood Code changes the meaning of the segment it must only be used in new messages as of v2.6.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Refer to <a href="HL70725">HL7 Table 0725 &ndash; Mood Codes</a>  in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for allowed values.</p>
