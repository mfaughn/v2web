<h2>Data Element #891 - Start Date/Time Offset</h2><h3>4 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 10 AIS.5 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the offset this service needs for the appointment, expressed in units of time relative to the scheduled start date/time.  This field allows the application to identify that the service is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment&#39;s start date/time.  The first component contains the offset amount.  An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field indicates that the service is required at the start date/time of the appointment.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the service is required after the appointment&#39;s start date/time.  Specifying a negative offset indicates that the service is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment.  Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment&#39;s start date/time.</p><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">This field is conditionally required.

    <li class="ins"><ins>&lt;p class=&quot;v2 v2_normalindented&quot;&gt;Definition:  This field contains the offset this resource needs for the appointment, expressed in units of time relative to the scheduled start date/time.  This field indicates to the application that the resource is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment&amp;#39;s start date/time.  The first component contains the offset amount.  An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field, indicates that the resource is required at the start date/time of the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;v2 v2_normalindented&quot;&gt;A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the resource is required after the appointment&amp;#39;s start date/time.  Specifying a negative offset indicates that the resource is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment.  Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment&amp;#39;s start date/time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;v2 v2_normalindented&quot;&gt;This field is conditionally required.
