<h2>Data Element #1413 - Endogenous Content of Pre-Dilution Diluent</h2><h3>2 distinct definitions</h3><br/>
<h4>          ---------- 1st Description: Ch. 13 TCC.7 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field represents a baseline value for the measured test that is inherently contained in the diluent.  In the calculation of the actual result for the measured test, this baseline value is normally considered.  </p><br/><h4>          ---------- 2nd Description: Ch. 13 TCD.5 ----------</h4><p class="v2 v2_normalindented">Definition:  This field represents the rest concentration of the measured test in the diluent. It is the value that is to be used for calculation of the concentration of pre-diluted specimens for this particular test code.</p>
